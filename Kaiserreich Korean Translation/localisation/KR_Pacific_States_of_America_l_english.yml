CAL_prepare_the_artillery:0 "포병 준비"
CAL_prepare_the_artillery_desc:0 "The indisputable winner of the Weltkrieg was Artillery. With it, our army may advance over a supressed enemy, as well as stop any enemy offensive dead in its tracks.

CAL_deWitt_in_Charge:0 "최고 사령관: 존 레스네 드윗"
CAL_deWitt_in_Charge_desc:0 "Major General John Lesesne DeWitt, unlike many members of the staff who advocate for us to aggressively assault the enemy positions, has proposed for us to focus on more careful advances with powerful consolidations. In his view, slow and steady advances paired up with a centralized high command will see our nation through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"

CAL_Marshall_in_command_desc:0 "Brigadier General George Catlett Marshall, has come to us with a damning prediction: If the West Coast fails to cross the Rockies and secure a foothold in the Midwest, then defeat will be assured. In his view, a quick advance through the Rockies with the help of motorized elements will be what see us through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
CAL_protecting_Columbia:0 "컬럼비아 방어"
CAL_protecting_Columbia_desc:0 "The Army War College, the Field Artillery School, Fort Benning and many other major buildings, locations and training sites have been damaged by the war, and their reconstruction should be one of our top priorities to bring the Army back on its feet now that the civil war is over."
CAL_military_research:0 "군사 연구"

CAL_weapon_designs:0 "신무기 설계"
CAL_weapon_designs_desc:0 "While the M1 Garand managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now.

CAL_90_division_Army_desc:0 "While Marshall originally envisioned that a reformed US Army would require a 265-Division Plan to be fully mobilized, the limitations of the West Coast make such a plan a pipe dream. As such, he has decided to adopt a 90-Division Plan, with the objective of raising a total of at least 90 divisions against America's enemies."
CAL_motorization:0 "Motorisation Program"
CAL_motorization_desc:0 "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries.

CAL_tank_production:0 "전차 생산 증강"
CAL_tank_production_desc:0 "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field.

CAL_Officer_instruction:0 "장교 명령"
CAL_Officer_instruction_desc:0 "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics. While this may put more of our officers in the line of fire, it will also ensure our new generation of officers gets first hand experience, as well as improving our army's leadership on the lower echelons as a whole."
CAL_recon_units:0 "정찰 부대"
CAL_recon_units_desc:0 "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."

CAL_one_switft_push_desc:0 "'The Object of Operation Glacier is to secure a lodgment area on the Midwest from which further offensive operations can be developed.

CAL_logistic_security:0 "군수보안"
CAL_logistic_security_desc:0 "Logistiscs are a not-so well known battlefield which will be vital for us if we wish to gain the upper hand against the radicals in the East.

CAL_Expand_the_Presidio_desc:0 "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."
CAL_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics:0 "'물고 버티기' 전략 개선"
CAL_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics_desc:0 "The 'Bite and Hold' tactic was first adopted by the British during the Weltkrieg, and as the tactic, while costly, proved to be a resounding success, now more than ever we need to look at its success and analyze how we can improve it so that we may have the best attack and consolidation tactics America has to offer."

CAL_bring_the_complex_west_desc:0 "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."
CAL_Columbia_needs_you:0 "컬럼비아는 당신이 필요하다!"
CAL_Columbia_needs_you_desc:0 "The Figure of Columbia, a woman wearing an American flag gown and a Phrygian hat, is the personification of the ideals of freedom and pursuit of liberty we fought so hard to achieve. With the tyrant overthrown and the radicals put down, the service of the American people to Columbia is not yet over. War looms in the horizon, and only the brave men of America can protect her and our nation from tyranny."
CAL_defense_contracts:0 "계약자 보호"

CAL_crossing_the_rockies:0 "로키 산맥을 가로질러"
CAL_crossing_the_rockies_desc:0 "The Rocky Mountains is a formidable geographic formation that separates our beloved West Coast from the carnage in the East.

As such, we should begin preparations for a smoother campaing through them."
CAL_gi_bill:0 "제대군인원호법"

In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.'

Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalization go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalized but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalization. Which version shall Congress go with?"

pacificstates.101.t:0 "Perez v. Sharp"
pacificstates.101.d:0 "The case involving the marriage of Andrea Perez to Sylvester Davis has finally reached the Supreme Court. Andrea Perez is classified as White while Sylvester Davis is considered Negro as per the US Census. However, California's law forbids "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and that "no license may be issued authorizing the marriage of a white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malay race". Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a writ of Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass. By denying them the license, they stated that the state was depriving them of the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony.\n\nHowever, the fate of their case is within the hands of the Supreme Court. What shall be decided?"

pacificstates.102.d:0 "In Los Angles news has been made of José Gallardo Díaz, who was recently found murdered near a swimming hole in Commerce, near LA. However, what made the story more newsworthy was the case of the men who are accused of murdering the man. The LA Police found a gang of 17 Men, of Mexican-American descent, nearby and believe that they are responsible for the crime. This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterized all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"

pacificstates.103.d:0 "With the war going on, rations have been imposed upon the public. Despite this, some within the Mexican-American Community fount this by wearing Zoot Suits that use materials that are needed for the war effort. Many White Americans regard wearing the Zoot Suit as a sign of criminality and loose morals. Tensions have continued in Los Angeles to rise till they exploded into violence. Soldiers and Sailors beat and engaged in rioting against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, the local press tended to praise the Sailors and Soldiers of 'having a cleansing effect to rid Los Angeles of Miscreants and Hoodlums'. One journalist on the scene, Carey McWilliams, wrote:\n\n'Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy'"

To many within the Mexican Congress, this is an outrage. Our own citizens who have gone to America for temporary work, not to mention those with ties to Mexico due to ancestral are being mistreated.

To calm tensions between America and Mexico, the McGucken Committee has been created lead by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, Joseph Thomas McGucken. The report concluded that Racism was clearly at the center of the riots as well as stating 'an aggravating practice (of the media) to link the phrase zoot suit with the report of a crime.' The governor of California appointed the Peace Officers Committee on Civil Disturbances, chaired by Robert W. Kenny, president of the National Lawyers Guild to make recommendations to the police.

In the movie Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power.

This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own physics research."

The last time he was here, the rockets were smaller than his thigh, and reached only a thousand feet in height. Now the rockets soar miles over the desert and touch down with their dummy weights.

pacificstates.150.t:0 "The Pacific Declaration"
pacificstates.150.d:0 "Ever since the first peaceful transfer of power between George Washington and John Adams, the government of the United States has prided itself on respecting the wishes of its population after an election. This unspoken contract between the people and their government has been violated by General Douglas MacArthur. In deposing the democratically-elected president in the name of 'preserving stability', he shattered the founding principles of our great nation. The destruction of the healthy civil-military relationship that has marked America since independence is a grievous slight to all the values we hold as a nation.\n\nIn response, the governors of California, Washington, and Oregon have issued a joint declaration condemning the General’s actions, and demanding his immediate withdrawal from Washington. We doubt he will respond positively, but like the patriots in 1776, we must take a stand against tyranny and oppression."

pacificstates.151.t:0 "Merriam Calls for New Elections"
pacificstates.151.d:0 "Frank Merriam, in coordination with the governors of Oregon and Washington, issued a stunning public statement today. In it, he claimed that if the so-called 'protector' of American values could not even respect the basic rights outlined in the Constitution, referring to Douglas MacArthur, it would be up to the people of the Pacific to defend America's inalienable rights. Claiming that MacArthur’s overthrow of the government was illegitimate, a new election would be held to select a new president - albeit amongst a limited slate of candidates in the Pacific region. Still, according to Merriam, whoever won this election would still have more legitimacy than MacArthur, and would be tasked with overseeing the return of the nation to democracy - by force, if needs be."

pacificstates.152.t:0 "Syndicalist Riot!"
pacificstates.152.d:0 "Following Jack Reed’s own declaration of MacArthur’s illegitimacy, many hoped that the capitalists and syndicalists could come together and preserve American democracy. Those naive aspirations were dashed when Governor Merriam ordered the National Guard to violently suppress a syndicalist protest which broke out in Sacramento. This escalated into widespread rioting across many Western cities, with Seattle in particular descending into violence. Longshoremen and teamsters broke into Seattle city hall, and proclaimed the city loyal to Reed’s workers republic in Chicago. Currently, the city is in a tense stand-off between National Guard units and the rebels holed up in the city hall."

pacificstates.153.t:0 "Election Violence"
pacificstates.153.d:0 "Tensions between the Pacific states and Washington have remained high over the last few weeks, but today, in the lead-up to the 'new election', they erupted into open conflict. While some of the ships in Naval Base San Diego were transferred to the East Coast after the first signs of unrest, many remained - along with sailors from across the country. Details are sketchy, but it appears a base commander, on orders from Washington, ordered sailors to take weapons from the base armory and head into the city. Deploying themselves at polling places, they prevented poll workers from setting up. When morning came, large mobs surrounded these soldiers, and began pelting them with rocks, bottles, and other debris. One of the sailors, hit by a bottle, fired back, and soon the city descended into chaos.\n\nCalifornia National Guard units were deployed, and pitched street battles between sailors loyal to MacArthur and the Guardsmen erupted, turning the tranquil city into a war zone."

With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."

pacificstates.202.t:0 "Failure of Operation Glacier"
pacificstates.202.d:0 "While Operation Glacier managed to get some territorial gains, the losses were too high with a gain too small to matter for the war effort.

pacificstates.203.t:0 "Rethinking our Tank Designs"
pacificstates.203.d:0 "With the Civil war over, we now have to revise the industrial measures we undertook during the war in order to enhance war-time production. One of these measures was Marshall's request for faster tanks for mass production, which came with the unfortunate drawback of being unreliable on harsh terrain, a trait which unfortunately has caused more than one headache to the newly recruited tank crews of our nation. Since our spending in military affairs shall be increased, some designers have approached us with newer models with better engines and suspension systems which shall ensure no regular breakdowns happen, but in exchange our experts predict our production speed will be reduced. What should we do?"

CAL_HENRY_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With the outbreak of the Civil War, 'Hap' found himself in the West Coast of America, where due to his constant disagreements with the national Chief of Air Corps of the Federal Government, he decided to join the Pacific Governors in their struggle, and provide any technical expertise he is able to in exchange for the promise of an independent air force."
CAL_DADDY_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps. With MacArthur's takeover of the government, Marshall refused to recognize his colleague as the army's generalissimo, and when the Pacific Governors declared their revolt, Marshall decided to join them, which earned him the promotion to Field Marshall. He is widely considered one of the most brilliant planners in America, and is one of the most experienced members of our staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
CAL_ALEXANDER_PATCH_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 23, 1889, in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, United States of America \n§YMilitary Career:§W Alexander McCarrell "Sandy" Patch, the son of the Cavalry Captain Alexander M. Patch, started his military career when he joined West Point in 1909. While a fan of the cavalry corp, he was quick to realize that cavalry would soon enough become obsolete in combat, so he chose to join the infantry, and graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1913. His first assignment was the 18th Infantry Regiment based in Texas, from where he was assigned to Pershing's 'Punitive Expedition' to Mexico, where he earned his promotion to first lieutenant. Without any major engagements for the US, Patch reached the rank of Captain in 1919 and was posted at Fort Benning as an instructor for four years. He'd apply for the Staunton Military Academy in Virginia as a professor of military science and tactics, a role which he'll keep until very recently. In the meantime, he attended the Field Officer's Course in 1922 and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, where he graduated with distinction in 1925, and finally graduated from the U.S. Army War College in 1932 as a lieutenant colonel. Patch's remarkable service record impressed General George Marshall, who tried to keep close contact with Patch in the following years of his graduation. When the civil war break out, Marshall implored Patch to join his staff in the Pacific Army, a request that Patch accepted and for which he was promoted to Brigadier General."
CAL_LEWIS_BRERETON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 21, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lewis Hyde Brereton began his military career in 1907, when he joined the Naval Academy with his brother and graduated in June 1911. However, before graduating he submitted a letter for resignation citing seasickness, which would make him unable to serve as a naval officer. His resignation was accepted, and he applied to be commissioned in the US Army and was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps on August 17, 1911. In September 1912, he undertook flight training in Rockwell Field, and would work temporarily on the air corp until he survived his second crash, after which he requested to be relieved from duty. He returned to the Coast Artillery Corps and in July 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and sent to the Philippines and would serve a year before returning to the US in March 1917, where he was assigned to duty in the Aviation Sector Headquarters in Washington D.C.. He'd go through a series of administrative posts and became a close assistant of Billy Mitchell in his attempts to make the air force independent. With Mitchell's resignation, his life took a downturn, as his wife left him, he suffered a crash and was found AWOL by accident while his mental health deteriorated greatly due to these developments. He was restored into service in August 1927 and was assigned to command of the 88th Observation Squadron at Post Field, Oklahoma, as well as an instructor at the Field Artillery School in Fort Sill. In 1931 he was posted in the Panama Canal Zone and received a promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1935 due to an excelling performance, which allowed him to salvage his reputation of his misfortunes in the late twenties. With the outbreak of the civil war becoming increasingly inevitable, he took a ship and arrived to San Diego right before hostilities began in order to meet his old acquaintance,'Hap' Arnold. Despite his inexperience in practical infantry combat, his excellent administrative and planning skills allowed him to become Brigadier General, by Arnold's own request."

He'd be promoted to First Lieutenant in 1927 after undergoing the Troop Officers' Course from the Cavalry school, where he became keenly interested in the prospect of mechanized warfare and the use of Tanks to break through enemy lines. He joined the Command and General Staff School in 1931, where he graduated as a Major in 1932 and became one of the army's strongest advocates for the use of tanks along with George S. Patton. As the country spiralled into civil war, Isaac sided with Marshall against MacArthur, leaving westwards from Fort Riley, where he was working as an instructor, and was awarded for his loyalty to Marshall with the rank of Brigadier General\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Very interested in the adoption of tanks and mechanized vehicles over infantry combat, but his ambitions may have to wait until the Civil War is over."

He was later assigned to the 15th Infantry Regiment in the Legation of Tianjin, where he learned to speak almost perfect Mandarin Chinese, and returned to the US to undergo a course in the Command and General Staff School, where his excellent grades made him eligible for an exchange program with the German Kriegsakademie, departing in early 1936. He never finished his courses however, as the Civil War began, and MacArthur took the reins of the government, Wedemeyer decided to travel back home and join the Pacific Forces, who he sees as the true American government.
