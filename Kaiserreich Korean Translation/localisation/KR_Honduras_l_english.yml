#Ideas
HON_peasant_republic:0 "농민 공화국"
HON_peasant_republic_desc:0 "Honduras is a 'peasant republic', that is to say it is run by the council in the name of the peasantry and its official name is the Peasants and Workers Republic of Honduras. In practice however, this government is moribund and has ceased to represent the people."
HON_december_revolution:0 "12월 혁명"
HON_december_revolution_desc:0 "The December Revolution took place in 1932, when peasants occupied the capital and a loose coalition of different groups took power as the "Peasant's Council of Honduras". Now the revolution is regarded as something of a failure, or possibly as having not gone far enough..."
HON_great_purge:0 "대숙청"
HON_great_purge_desc:0 "The Great Purge was a mass persecution of members of the army primarily, who had links to America. While the commercial realities of the situation would mean that American influence crept back in and the Monroe Doctrine remained enforced it still crippled the Honduran army, which is something I guess?"

honduras.200.t:0 "State of the Army"
honduras.200.d:0 "The Honduran Army is a small one and currently suffers from an extreme lack of competent leadership due to the purges that have occurred. There are two major competing schools of thought: One proposes professionalising the army into a small and elite force that is very selective, the other a large army focuses entirely around defence rather than offensive operations outside of Honduras."
honduras.200.a:0 "Point the loud end at the other guy."
honduras.201.t:0 "Acquiring Heavy Weapons"
honduras.201.d:0 "Some joyful salesmen have put forward various offers for us to obtain artillery pieces for the Honduran Army. Enough for a few support companies. Should we take the offer?"

honduras.202.t:0 "Terrain Adaptation"
honduras.202.d:0 "Honduras, and Central America in general, has a whole variety of terrain available to work in. In our mountainous regions we can train infantry to ski for improved mobility, or teach them specialised tactics for fighting in the jungle. Furthermore we could adopt a balanced approach, and try to build an all-terrain army."

#Events
honduras.1.t:0 "The Original Banana Republic"
honduras.1.d:0 "Having come under the domination of various US fruit companies that turned the nation into an economic enclave, Honduras seemingly came to breaking point in 1933. A peasant uprising stormed the capital and lead to the suicide of the sitting president, however the government established in the aftermath of the revolution became dominated once more by US interests and a clique of intelligentsia. Now what remains of Honduras' state is a mess, purged of dissenters and relying on military force to keep the railways to the ports open."
honduras.1.a:0 "It's not much, but it's home."

honduras.2.t:0 "Desertions In the Army"
honduras.2.d:0 "For a long time now we have relied on military force to keep the narrow railways connecting plantations to ports in order to keep our economy afloat. However with the ongoing economic crisis and political discontent even that has become uncertain, with hundreds of men fleeing their posts to join up with one militia or another."
honduras.2.a:0 "They'll come back when they're hungry."

honduras.150.t:0 "The Honduran Experiment"
honduras.150.d:0 "The United States has begun experimenting with a new paradigm of imperialism it seems, although perhaps one familiar to Hawaii. A combination of business coercion, military force and diplomatic pressure has led to a coup d'état headed by Pedro Del Valle, a marine commander of Puerto Rican extraction. Establishing a new "American Mandate" in our country he has thus ensured its loyalty to the USA."
honduras.150.a:0 "God Bless America!"

honduras.194.t:0 "Honduras wants to buy the USS South Dakota"
honduras.194.d:0 "Del Valle's new American Mandate in Honduras has approached us offering to buy the Armoured Cruiser "USS South Dakota" as a prestige project for his government. Should we accept? The old girl was to be sold for scrap otherwise."
honduras.194.a:0 "We could use the cash."

honduras.195.t:0 "The Purchase is Approved"
honduras.195.d:0 "The USS South Dakota now sails for our ports! Truly this is a great day for this young nation."
honduras.195.a:0 "Hurrah!"

honduras.100.t:0 "The American Economy Dips Further"
honduras.100.d:0 "Somehow they've managed it, with the collapse of the German stock market the investments of American firms have gone from bad to worse and the import market has fallen even further as consumer spending on all but the most essential goods bottoms out."
honduras.100.a:0 "Not much call for bananas..."

honduras.101.t:0 "Monroe Lapses"
honduras.101.d:0 "Armed conflict has struck the USA, throwing her government into chaos and threatening to unseat it entirely. In these dire times the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine is obviously impossible."
honduras.101.a:0 "A crisis yes, but also an opportunity."

honduras.102.t:0 "A Railway Bombing"
honduras.102.d:0 "Disaster struck early this morning as a unit of deserters, in protest at the council's policy, bombed the section of railway they used to guard. Reports have already arrived of heists on the now stopped trains."
honduras.102.a:0 "Round up some loyalists and get after them!"

honduras.103.t:0 "Skirmishes With Deserters"
honduras.103.d:0 "Perhaps unsurprisingly when they deserted the soldiers mostly kept their guns. This has meant that the loyalists we sent to track down and arrest the railways bombers have been fired upon, and a running skirmish is now occurring north of the capital."
honduras.103.a:0 "Well at least it can't get worse."

honduras.104.t:0 "Into El Salvador"
honduras.104.d:0 "The militants have fled into El Salvador, hoping to base themselves there and stage a proper campaign of guerrilla warfare to overthrow the council. However it seems our soldiers show no signs of giving up the chase..."
honduras.104.a:0 "I spoke too soon."

honduras.105.t:0 "Military Clashes with El Salvador"
honduras.105.d:0 "It seems our abortive attempt at a swift arrest has escalated beyond our control, with an open firefight breaking out between our army and theirs."
honduras.105.a:0 "Damn and blast!"

honduras.106.t:0 "Victory!"
honduras.106.d:0 "It seems we have won the clash with our neighbour over the escaped Honduran soldiers. Looks like we'll be celebrating tonight!"
honduras.106.a:0 "Break out the champagne!"

honduras.107.t:0 "Defeat!"
honduras.107.d:0 "It seems our forces have lost the clash with our neighbour over the escaped Honduran soldiers. Looks like it'll be a grim evening."
honduras.107.a:0 "Humiliating..."

honduras.108.t:0 "Stalemate"

honduras.108.a:0 "..."

honduras.109.t:0 "The Trial of the Mutineers"
honduras.109.d:0 "Today the council was due to sit in judgement of the mutineers of earlier in the year. However, at the last minute, a crowd of lowly peasants stormed the courtroom and set them free. An emergency meeting of the council has been convened to try and address the issue later."
honduras.109.a:0 "Oh no..."

honduras.110.t:0 "Asking El Salvador"
honduras.110.d:0 "With military force having failed we seemingly have no option but to ask El Salvador to arrest the mutineers on our behalf."
honduras.110.a:0 "Very well, telegram them."

honduras.111.t:0 "Honduras Requests Their Criminals"
honduras.111.d:0 "A group of mutinous Honduran soldiers recently crossed the border, prompting an armed clash between us and the poorly-trained Honduran soldiers in pursuit. Now Honduras has requested they be repatriated."
honduras.111.a:0 "Make use of this for propaganda."
honduras.111.b:0 "We might as well send them back."

honduras.112.t:0 "El Salvador humiliates us!"
honduras.112.d:0 "El Salvador returned our message today informing us that there will be no surrender to our demands."
honduras.112.a:0 "How embarrassing."

honduras.1122.t:0 "Anti-Salvadorian Militants"
honduras.1122.d:0 "In response to the humiliation of our great nation by the vile Salvadorians militant groups have begun forming, based near the border and dedicated to fighting off any incursion or retaliation from them. Known as the "Mancha Brava" they form a secret society of sorts, malleable in the defence of the nation."
honduras.1122.a:0 "It's something..."

honduras.113.t:0 "Victory over Nicaragua"
honduras.113.d:0 "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The revolutionary threat from Nicaragua has been soundly defeated and all that remains is the smouldering wreck of their attempt to overthrow Honduran might."
honduras.113.a:0 "A great day for our nation."

honduras.1040.t:0 "Honduran Forces Enter"
honduras.1040.d:0 "Honduran military units claiming to be in hot pursuit of rebels crossed the border into El Salvador today. When the army attempted to turn them back the ill-disciplined rabble forced the checkpoint and wounded two of our men in the crossfire!"
honduras.1040.a:0 "We'll make them pay!"

honduras.3.t:0 "The Emergency Council Session: Callejas' Rally"
honduras.3.d:0 "While ostensibly a member of the revolutionary council Venancio Callejas has always stood somewhat apart from it. Before the emergency session to deal with the political crisis he has held a rally of his supporters in public, both to rally support and as a show of force to both the army and the council. Indeed many whisper that simply handing him and his redshirts the premiership could inject the vitality the moribund revolution needs."
honduras.3.a:0 "Just what we need, more strongmen."

honduras.4.t:0 "The Emergency Council Session: Castro's Connections"
honduras.4.d:0 "General Jose Leon Castro has been a key player in rallying military support for the council for a while now, associating with various officer's cliques and slowly forming his own band of loyalists. It is also well known that despite the anti-American policy of the revolutionary council he and other members are in extensive contact with the United Fruit Company that still grips the economy. There are even murmurs in the council that his influence would make a military regime preferable to the absolute loss of power that would accompany major reforms."

honduras.6.t:0 "The Emergency Session"
honduras.6.d:0 "The emergency session of the Honduran Council has begun, to decide the future of the peasant's republic. A large crowd had gathered outside of council chambers, with the police being unwilling to disperse them. The first task of the council is to elect a new chairman to set the agenda for the meeting. Council members Callejas and Castro have nearly come to blows over their differing views and wild accusations are made by either side while councilors Morales and Galvez have formed a united front arguing for the dissolution of the council and its reformation as an elected body; ultimately there seem to be only a few options..."
honduras.6.a:0 "General Castro will chair the council and institute martial law."

honduras.7.d:0 "With the recent end of the civil war the United States can once again begin to look outward and pursue an active foreign policy. As part of that the United Fruit Company's executives has reached us with disturbing news; the popular council that governs Honduras is currently under siege in their own government building by revolutionary socialists. The government is lobbying for an intervention by our forces, most likely marines sent in to shore up Jose Leon Castro, a well-regarded military man. There has been a controversial proposal, however, that we might send our troops in to assume more direct control of Honduran affairs..."
honduras.7.a:0 "We would rather not risk it."

honduras.9.t:0 "The USA Backs Castro"
honduras.9.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning a telegram reached the council, instructing them to immediately arrest Councillor Callejas even as US warships sailed into our ports combat-ready. Following that General Jose Leon Castro is recognised by the United States as the legitimate President of the Republic of Honduras. Their instructions couldn't be clearer..."
honduras.9.a:0 "Viva El Presidente!"
honduras.9.b:0 "Well he has to win an election first!"

honduras.10.t:0 "US Marines Invade!"
honduras.10.d:0 "It seems the council's call for American support might not have been taken the way they thought. Early this morning US warships shelled Honduran ports and disgorged marines who set about occupying them and declared a 'Provisional Republican Government' of the country. Venancio Callejas, in response, has lead a militia to seize control of the council chambers and has had several council members hung."

honduras.11.a:0 "Morales clutches it!"
honduras.11.b:0 "Galvez wins out!"
honduras.11.c:0 "Truth is, the elections were rigged from the start."

honduras.12.t:0 "Del Valle's Assault Fails!"
honduras.12.d:0 "In a drastic turn of events it would seem the Marine Corps' attempt to seize control of Honduras has been pushed back, with a revolutionary socialist government massacring their Peasant's Council and declaring absolute independence. Some hardliners are arguing that to back down now would be a show of weakness, while others believe we should bide our time."
honduras.12.a:0 "Of course they realize this means war"
honduras.12.b:0 "We don't need to go to war so soon over Honduras"

honduras.13.t:0 "Premier Callejas Takes Control"
honduras.13.d:0 "Having cleared out the last of the opposition and been appointed chairman of the council, the assumption of power by Venancio Callejas has become a fiat accompli. His new state promises to be vigorous and progressive and bring Honduras into the world of 20th century socialism."
honduras.13.a:0 "Long Live The People!"

honduras.14.t:0 "General Castro Takes Control"
honduras.14.d:0 "Today General Jose Castro was sworn in as the President of Honduras and elevated to head of the armed forces.
