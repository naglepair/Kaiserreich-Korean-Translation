The forty were reduced by lot to 12 who named 25 members, those 25 had to be approved by 9 of the 12. The 9 would name 45 and each member had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 45 members were reduced by lot to 11. These 11 named 45 who had to be approved by 9 of the 11. these 45 were finally reduced by lot to 25 and they would choose the doge.\n\nNaturally the system is considered rather archaic.
