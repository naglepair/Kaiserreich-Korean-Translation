The officers in the armed forces and the nationalist reactionaries are demanding a Chinese economy meant for the Chinese and a firm rejection of Western ideals of socialism and liberalism, however, a direct attack upon Sun Yat-sen's ideals might prove dangerous."

repchi.29.t:0 "Long Yun covers before us!"
repchi.29.d:0 "Yesterday, in a thoroughly subdued spirit, the Autocrat of Kunming announced his unwavering support for the Chinese Republic. Our men in the border areas report that the advancing formations of the National Revolutionary Army have only encountered celebration and a shower of flowers and kisses from the young women of Yunnan on their advance towards Kunming. Dr. Sun would have been proud of us!"
repchi.29.a:0 "The Revolution is not over yet!"

repchi.30.d:0 "Our attempts at reuniting the bandit lair of Yunnan with the light of the Republic through peaceful means have been rebuked by the Kunming administration.

An agreement will bring Yunnan under Republican control without bloodshed, but our credibility might suffer tremendously. The entire nation eagerly awaits the Republican response."

repchi.33.t:0 "The Parliamentary elections"
repchi.33.d:0 "Four years have passed since the Guangzhou Revolution washed off the shame of the German Intervention of 1926 in a river of righteous resistance. As per the constitution and the San-min Doctrine Free China is to experience the second batch of elections to the National Assembly and the old guard of parties have been readying themselves for months. However, new claimants to the popular mandate have also arisen in the Young China Party."

repchi.34.t:0 "The German Companies"
repchi.34.d:0 "The profit-driven capitalist system of exploitation and oppression of the major German companies in Southern China was one of the major causes of the Guangzhou Revolution. Thus a call for the expropriation of the financial cooperatives has been voiced within the assembly. However, certain members of the incumbent government argue that such an act could result in a permanent weakening of our ability to develop our industry."
repchi.34.a:0 "We need their industrial expertise."
repchi.34.b:0 "Expropriate the oppressors!"
repchi.35.t:0 "A.O.G.회사를 제명한다"
repchi.35.d:0 "Following the downfall of the A.O.G., the Chinese republican government in Guangzhou has added insult to injury by proclaiming the Asian sub-companies of Krupp, Opel and Siemens unwanted in their 'Free China'. Our reaction to this humiliation must be swift and decisive!"

repchi.35.b:0 "Well, at least we still hold Tsingtau"
repchi.36.t:0 "칭타우 최후통첩"
repchi.36.d:0 "Our decision to expropriate the German companies has resulted in a list of demands being cabled to us from German-held Tsingtau. In short, the Kaiser demands suitable monetary compensation for his subjects being targeted by our Government. Such a claim is outrageous, but with German Schutztruppen stationed nearby, to seek a direct confrontation with the Kaiserreich might not be the wisest path to tread."
repchi.36.a:0 "Berlin's bluffing, reject the Kaiser's claims!"
repchi.36.b:0 "We must submit in the name of peace."
repchi.37.t:0 "Guangzhou laughs at us!"
repchi.37.d:0 "The demand dispatched by our governor in Tsingtau has been thoroughly ignored by the Republican government. The domestic as well as international press is bombarding us with critique and scorn for not standing up to such disrespect from a puny Chinese clique. The Guangzhou government must be chastised!"

repchi.37.b:0 "I tell you, they're a cunning race!"
repchi.38.t:0 "The Germans flee before us!"
repchi.38.d:0 "We have driven the Kaiser's troops from our borders and seized Hanoi from the local colonial governor. Our troops are poised to drive deeper into Indochina and with the interior only weakly defended, now might be a good time to offer Berlin peace terms."

repchi.38.b:0 "Fight 'till our banners fly over Saigon!"
repchi.39.t:0 "Guangzhou offers terms"
repchi.39.d:0 "The war in China has turned out to be a regular catastrophe. Our forces have been routed from their bases in Haikou and Naoming, whilst Republican troops are posed to invade German Indochina! The Chinese are proposing a ceasefire in return for our colonies in China. Maybe it would be wise to accept."

repchi.40.d:0 "In 1926 the German imperialists imposed the Manchu dynasty upon the northern provinces of China, yet their rule hasn't improved since the Xinhai Revolution. With Yunnan and the A.O.G. gone, the time seems ripe for a repeat of the glorious days of 1911."

repchi.41.d:0 "The would be revolutionaries of Guangxi have deployed several armies on our border, threatening the important industrial city of Nanjing. Although we knew such confrontation with the resurgent Republic would be unavoidable, the Imperial council is still debating our means of response fiercely."

repchi.41.b:0 "Bah, they will feel our wrath soon enough."
repchi.110.t:0 "Republican agitators within our borders!"
repchi.110.d:0 "Jiangsu province is in complete disarray! Agitators and spies from Guangzhou are spreading their vile propaganda about the imperial house at an alarming rate, and in the foreign concessions in Nanjing revolutionaries are busy making bombs and banners for planned demonstrations against our rule. This cancer of democracy must be cut out, or we might face even greater resistance in our enforcement of the heavenly mandate."

repchi.42.d:0 "The infiltrators dispatched by our secret service have managed to rouse the inhabitants of Nanjing and the surrounding areas against Manchu rule. Barricades are being set up in the streets and demonstrators clash with loyalist troops around all the major public buildings. Our general staff is in agreement in its assessment of the situation. With a certain amount of undercover military support, the Nanjing Revolution might actually stand a chance."

repchi.43.d:0 "Horrible, horrible news have just arrived from Nanjing. Whilst our troops attempted to restore imperial authority in the city's centre, rebels opened fire upon our men with automatic weapons. Nanjing is in full revolt and our men have been forced back whilst the Republican five-coloured flag is hoisted throughout the ancient capital."

repchi.44.t:0 "The Northern Expedition Commences"
repchi.44.d:0 "With one swift stroke, Nanjing and much of Jiangsu province have come under Republican control. However, the Qing have dispatched its lackeys to quell the nascent movement of national revolution and without the direct assistance of the NRA, the brave freedom fighters in the ancient capital might succumb to the immense pressure of the Manchu onslaught!"
repchi.44.a:0 "The revolution isn't over yet!"
repchi.45.t:0 "Fate of the German Colonies"
repchi.45.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened. The German Kaiserreich has suffered a crushing defeat in Europe that has sent shock waves throughout the world. With panic erupting in all of the Kaiser's Chinese concessions and the local Schutztruppen hard pressed to maintain order, now might be the right time to proclaim an ultimatum regarding the German treaty ports."

repchi.48.d:0 "Ever since the downfall of the first Chinese Republic and the resurrection of Manchu rule, the largest Chinese cities on the eastern seaboard have been ruled by a conglomerate of the foreign powers. However, as the star of the western states is fading whilst the Chinese dragon surges to the skies, the possibilities of a reunification with the Legation Cities seem better than ever before."

According to the communique, we are entitled to widespread home rule although matters of foreign policy and defence will be decided by the central government. Considering the strength of the resurgent Republican regime, this offer seems too good to be true!"

The Confederation of Legation Cities set up after our 1926 intervention to manage international trade with the Chinese market has been forced into a series of negotiations with the Republican regime. The leader of the Confederation's cabinet has approached us, as the prime guardian of Asian stability, to secure German support against the Chinese menace."

repchi.54.d:0 "In retaliation to our ultimatum regarding the foreign controlled Treaty Ports, Berlin has deployed men and munitions to the international concessions in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

repchi.96.d:0 "Directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, The Spring River Flows East is a two part epic movie depicting the hardships of a poor working class couple during the trials and tribulations of the Chinese Unification. Portraying the corruption that greed and power holds over the people, the movie's message has been interpreted by many as a direct attack upon the policies of the Liberal party. However, the film has been a smashing success at the box office as well as with the critics."

repchi.104.a:0 "It belongs to China!"
repchi.104.b:0 "Let the idea slide"
repchi.105.t:0 "RoC demands"
repchi.105.d:0 "After centuries, the reborn Republic of China decided to demand Macao from us. The Second Republic is now probably one of the strongest states in the Far East and fighting them over control of Macau is probably not a good idea."

repchi.105.b:0 "They will have to fight for it!"
