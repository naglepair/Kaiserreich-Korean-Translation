#Cabinet Reorganisation
#The administrative system of Nguyen dynasty is literally a living fossil. The six boards were organised along the lines of traditional Chinese governments since the Tang dynasty. During the Duy Tan era, the system was slightly modified, but now it's terribly outdated. Even the most conservative ministers agree that the cabinet must be reorganised to adapt to new situation.
#Prime Minister
#Emperor Minh Mang established the rule that Nguyen Dynasty doesn't need a prime minister because the rule of monarch is total. However, it's hard for a monarch to handle the administration of a modern state, especially for emperor Baodai...
