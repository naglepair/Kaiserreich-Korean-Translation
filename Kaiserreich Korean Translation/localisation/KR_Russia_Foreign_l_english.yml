Of course we will have to change the situation here, but it will take us a lot of time."

rusfor.1275.d:0 "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."

rusfor.1276.t:0 "Control over Azerbaijan"
rusfor.1276.d:0 "Since we have given our guarantees to Azerbaijan, the Russian business uses the profits of the cooperation between two countries. Maybe now it is the best time to expand our control over this Caucasian country and strengthen our positions in the Caspian region?"

rusfor.1276.b:0 "We don't need it."

rusfor.1277.t:0 "Restoring control over the Northern Caucasus."
rusfor.1277.d:0 "After the reunification of Don-Kuban with Russia, our government faced the problem of integration of the eastern mountainous districts of the former Cossack state. During the 1920s and early 1930s Ataman Krasnov supported the Terek Cossack Host, which consisted of many Russians, Ossetians and other Christian nations, who kept this part of the Caucasus under Yekaterinodar's control. We have currently deployed the Russian army in the region, but this is a temporary measure. Multiple plans for the reconstruction and pacification of the region have been proposed and we should choose one of them."
rusfor.1277.a:0 "Put the region under control of the local civilian Russians."
rusfor.1277.b:0 "Continue Krasnov's policy - support the Terek Cossack Host and its nations."
rusfor.1277.c:0 "Keep the region under military control!"

rusfor.1278.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1278.d:0 "After we had restored military bases in such towns of the Northern Caucasus as Vladikavkaz and Grozny and had left here the limited part of the troops, we have transfered the control over this territory to the local Russians, who had been both members of the Terek Cossack Host or just citizens in the various towns and villages. It seems that while the Russian part of the region has started to recover very quick, the districts without Russian involvement are sliding into the anarchy and tribal wars. Now many leaders of the non-Russian nations of the Northern Caucasus ask us to restore control over the whole region and promise that they will serve well to the Russian government, since it is the only power, which can secure the region from the eternal crisis."
rusfor.1278.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1279.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1279.d:0 "Since we started to support the Terek Cossack Host, we could reach an order rather quick, but because our support exceeded the extent of the support from Krasnov's government, the Host started to expand itself over the non-Christian territory of the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, which naturally led to the multiple conflicts, especially between the Russians and Ossetians on one side and the Chechens and Ingushes on the other. Moreover, the readiness of the Russian government to deal with the local small nations and tribes led to conflicts with them in Dagestan, where many nations want to become a junior partner of Russia and dominate over their neighbours using Russian protection. All these conflicts will be solved by our government, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1279.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1280.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1280.d:0 "We kept the army deployed in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus and it brought the order to the Russian part of this land, where the local citizens are finally free from the raids and attacks of the mountainous nations.
