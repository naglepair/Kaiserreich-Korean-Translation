POR_the_moderating_power_desc:0 "The separation and balance of Powers between the Judiciary, Executive and Legislative branches works well in theory, however, as it stands, there are too many disagreements between these branches for the government to properly function.

POR_imperial_pride_desc:0 "Portugal is at its zenith in terms of wealth and riches; our Kingdom has never stretched so far and ruled over so many. Few empires in the history of mankind can even compare to all that has been done by us since Vasco Da Gama left our shores.

POR_state_of_faithful_desc:0 "Portugal is and always will be a Christian nation. We were founded in His Name, we expanded with His Blessing, and, even now in our zenith, He gives us newfound will to continue reformation and better this world."
POR_youth:0 "포르투갈의 청년"

POR_expand_local_power_desc:0 "현지의 백작, 공작, 그리고 후작들은 너무 오랫동안 영지를 명목상으로만 소유하고 있었으며 그들은 정치적 영향력과는 무관했습니다. 이제, 행정 문제에 대한 지방 자치권을 확대하기 위해 시의회가 앞장서고 그들의 역할은 바뀌어야 합니다."
POR_local_rulership:0 "지방 자치"
POR_local_rulership_desc:0 "Who else would best know how to deal with problems within a community than community leaders themselves? They've lived within their local communities for hundreds of years, and can see more than just spreadsheets when they gaze upon the wheat fields and the hard working folk, who are toiling away."
POR_codified_decentralization:0 "권력 분립 명문화"
POR_codified_decentralization_desc:0 "The increase of power and autonomy for local leaders can also pave the way for future conflict between the local leadership and the central government.

POR_abolish_parlament_desc:0 "그의 지혜로, 그리고 많은 안타까움을 담고서, 대통령은 포르투갈 국민들에게 구시대적 사고에서 벗어나지 못한 의회가 곧 사라지게 될 것이라고 알려야 합니다; 포르투갈에서 최고로 뛰어나고 가장 엄격한 자들로 구성된 상원이 이제 의회 내의 기회주의자들 대신 입법권을 행사할 것입니다."
POR_economical_strongstance:0 "경제 보강"
POR_economical_strongstance_desc:0 "우리는 정치인들의 탁상공론이 만든 경제적 견해나 개념이 새로운 포르투갈을 방해하도록 허용할 수 없습니다. 비록 그것이 그들 중 몇몇에게 이 왕국의 실권을 쥐고 있는 사람들이 누구인지 상기시키는 것을 의미한다고 하더라도 말입니다."

POR_navy:0 "헤지아 마리냐"
POR_navy_desc:0 "Our navy, while undergoing expansion during the Weltkrieg, is still not capable of properly defending our overseas provinces, nor our coastline! Relying on allied navies may not be an option available to us, so we must act now."
POR_raise_regulos:0 "Raise Regúlo Regiments"

POR_punish_traitors_desc:0 "Despite our best effort, rebels within Mozambique have continued to exist and resent our glorious kingdom.

POR_imperio:0 "Ultramarine Effort"
POR_imperio_desc:0 "Our overseas provinces, while a centrepiece of the Restored Government, still lag behind in many ways when compared to the mainland and are, in many ways, threatened by those who envy what Portugal has done for her people.

POR_enforce_colonial_act:0 "Enforce the Colonial Act"
POR_enforce_colonial_act_desc:0 "While groundbreaking legislation has been approved in the past decades, the laws have not been enforced within our overseas provinces. We mustn't allow complacency to take hold; laws are made to be enforced and we shall enforce them!"
POR_protect_mozambique:0 "Protect Mozambique"
POR_protect_mozambique_desc:0 "According to our top military experts, the best approach in defending Mozambique would be the forfeiture of its northern and unruly region, thereby establishing a safe perimeter within the Zambeze.

POR_casa_dos_estudantes_do_imperio_desc:0 "A formal house for students from our overseas provinces, the Home of the Students of the Empire is now be a beacon of pride and efficiency. This investment in academia will surely have more... practical uses for our government, as well."

POR_macau:0 "Protect and Develop Macau"
POR_macau_desc:0 "Macau is a crown jewel of the empire, envied by the Chinese because of its prosperity. However, it is also very far away from the Portugal. This means that, in the case of an attack, the province would have to hold on without support. To make matters worse, the government's hold on the province is also very poor. In light of this information, we must prepare initiatives to defend and develop Macau."
POR_goa:0 "Defend the State of India"
POR_goa_desc:0 "The State of India, once safely protected due to the British control of the Indian subcontinent, is continually at risk of being attacked by either the Syndicalists in the east or the treacherous Princes in the south.

POR_grande_armada:0 "거대한 함대"
POR_grande_armada_desc:0 "Possessing a carrier fleet is more than having a few airplanes at sea; it is the possibility of power projection, both aerially and navally, and controlling the naval battlefield.

POR_raiding_squads:0 "Planning for Asymmetrical Warfare"
POR_raiding_squads_desc:0 "Planning a war against the world's biggest navy is not, by any means, an easily accomplished task. It will require much effort and calculation with our allies, admirals, and seamen. However, the tactics we use to deal with the War at Sea will certainly be crucial."
POR_submarines:0 "Hunting Teams"
POR_submarines_desc:0 "One of the most crucial aspects of a raiding navy is operational autonomy and co-operation between the ships within the fleet. By organising our forces to act as 'Hunting Teams', which will be used to harass and attack enemy light ships and supply ships, we can ensure that our raiding navy will be extremely efficient."
POR_ubarcos:0 "제국 잠수함 사령부"

We won more than just our sovereignty, but, like the great Afonso Henriques, we don't fight for conquest but for freedom. As Aetius once did, we shattered the illusion of Hunnic invincibility, and people around the world will honour with us the heroes in our struggle! Não Passarão! Angola é Portugal!"
POR_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward our Loyal Subjects"
POR_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "We often see the true mettle of a vassal when his liege is on the edge of a knife. Risking everything, many who could have been complacent fought for us. Some out of genuine loyalty, others for the thrill of battle, and some simply to prevent the alternative: being ruled by the Butcher of Mahenge, who sees all non-Germans as little more than beasts of Burden. All will have their loyalty rewarded!"
POR_redouble_investments:0 "Redouble our Colonial Investments"

POR_zambia_e_nossa:0 "Snatch Zambia!"
POR_zambia_e_nossa_desc:0 "Because of their thirst for earthly riches, the Germans have completely failed in their duty.

POR_pinko:0 "The Pink Map"
POR_pinko_desc:0 "Because of the anarchy that has taken ahold of Africa, we may finally achieve the old goal of the Pink Map and exert control over vast swathes of land between Angola and Mozambique.

Despite the successful assassination, public reception has not been unanimous and many bystanders were wounded during the operation.

The city is still in shock and the perpetrator, along with his supporters, have been detained for investigation by the local police. It appears we are already managing to destabilise the Mittelafrikan government. It should be noted that he used a weapon supplied by us, but we are confidant it won't get traced back to us."
por.321.a:0 "Of course it won't be."

por.322.d:0 "Another update; earlier today some 'bandits' raided and stole supplies from a Mittelafrikan military depot and then escaped with the supplies back to their camp in Mozambique. Those 'bandits' were of course supplied and trained by us; they are getting bold and don't even fear the Mittelafrikan Askari any more! We have heard rumours that the Mittelafrikan government is having a meeting soon to decide what to do about these 'bandits' and the destabilising effect they are having."
