Much of our industry has traditionally relied upon agriculture, but times have changed. If we want to keep agriculture as a vital part of our economy, then we need to upgrade our farming facilities. Similarly, much of Ireland's road systems are in a state of complete disrepair, and currently the responsibility for repair work of any kind falls to private enterprise. Our transport network in general could be considerably improved, allowing us to move both people and economic goods around the country at a more rapid rate.

ire.5.d:0 "For some time now, there has been a slow but surely growing unrest in the northern region of Ireland, Ulster. Stirred up by predominantly Protestant Unionists, who advocate for closer ties with England, Ulster has become something of a problem region for the Dáil.

Led by Hugo MacNeill, the commission has presented their initial report. MacNeill believes that, contrary to the claims by Liam Lynch and his soldiers, it was not the Unionist protesters who instigated the fatal clashes with the army. Instead, he believes that Lynch and his men were looking for a fight all along and later planted weapons on dead protesters to give themselves an alibi. If these allegations are true, it's a shocking revelation and may have wide reaching consequences for the IRA."

The wealthier note the lack of democracy as they knew it in the US while the less well off feel that their situation is being exploited by Irish business. Locals also have grievances as they feel the newcomers are stealing jobs from them as well as seeing their cultural traditions as not in keeping with native Irish culture. To top it off Unionists view the immigrants as an attempt by the Republic to colonise Ulster, where many have settled."

# Unionist Protest March
ire.36.t:0 "연합주의자들의 가두시위"
ire.36.d:0 "News has spread from Belfast this morning that the Unionists are organising a protest march against what they perceive to be unfair treatment from the government in Dublin. Since Ireland gained her independence, the people of Ulster have become increasingly marginalised and attempts to 'green' up the region and purge the British legacy there have thus far failed. The idea of letting this march go undeterred does not sit well with the majority of the Irish people, or the government. But stopping it may only make the situation worse..."

Her body had obviously been taken some distance from the site of the murder itself. A letter claiming responsibility arrived at the Gardaí headquarters in Belfast, sent allegedly by the Ulster Volunteer Force. The murder appears to have been an act of retaliation for the government's recent decision to ban an attempted Unionist Protest March. News of the murder has spread like wildfire across the nation, and the populace are shocked."

ire.37.t:0 "Unionist Preparations Cause Tensions"
ire.37.d:0 "After a local government representative announced that there would be no official efforts made to prevent the Unionist protest march, local Catholic residents have loudly voiced concerns to the regional Gardaí. They claim that the protest march is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to intimidate the Catholic community in Belfast, who find themselves still partially outnumbered by the Protestant, largely Unionist, majority. The demands have not fallen on deaf ears and there is a growing call for the Irish Republican Army to be deployed along the planned march route to protect the Catholic community and make sure things don't get out of hand."

Whilst there were concerns that the Unionists may turn their frustration into violence, these fears in the end turned out to go unrealised. Whilst this march has proven to be a contentious affair for the nation, at least it didn't result in any bloodshed today. Nonetheless, the Unionists growing demand for independence can no longer be ignored. There must be decisive action to address the question of Ulster, lest the situation grow out of control."

Whilst it is still difficult to understand the full scale of what happened, it is understood that a conflict broke out between the IRA forces commanded by Eoin O'Duffy, and several of the protesters.

ire.43.d:0 "Following the shift in power that occurred when the British were chased out of Ireland, many Catholic business owners rose to prominence in Ulster. However, their rise in socio-economic status came often at cost to the Protestant residents of the region, who had previously enjoyed such unbridled dominance over the Catholic minority. A group of Ulster Unionist factory workers went on strike today citing unfair pay and unwarranted treatment by their Catholic employer. Their strike soon turned violent when they were attacked by what some believe to be hired thugs. Nobody was killed, although Belfast City Hospital had plenty of patients in the immediate aftermath. This will not do the tense situation in Ulster any favours."

The man was previously known to the local police force as a prominent member of a Unionist volunteers group with local ties in the Waterside. There have already been cries that the murder was committed by a Catholic and that the police will turn a blind eye. However warranted or unwarranted these claims may be, the situation in Ulster is, as ever, volatile."

Thousands of Ulstermen and women came out in the sunshine to listen to prominent Unionist speakers. There was plenty of time for song and dance, but just as much time for increasingly violent rhetoric regarding the status of Ulster in relation to the rest of Ireland. Whilst the words 'revolt' or 'uprising' might not have been spoken out loud, they were certainly thought. Of great concern to the Irish government will be the sheer number of people attending the rally. Clearly, the Unionist movement enjoys widespread popular support."

He particularly chastised the current regime and the economic neglect paid towards Ulster during the past decade, and demanded that every son and daughter of Ulster be prepared to fight for the prosperity and, if needs be, freedom of the region."

Two men believed to have been responsible for the bombing were shot dead by the Gardaí as they attempted to flee the scene and put up resistance when asked to stand down. At least one of the men has been identified as a Belfast native with known Unionist ties. This terrifying escalation of the on-going conflict in Ulster is tantamount to a declaration of war upon Ireland and her people, and the public outcry has been enormous. The Irish people are baying for blood, and it is Ulster that may have to pay the price."

Ulster Unionists are said to be considering their options whilst the Irish Republican Army is preoccupied with the on-going conflict, and they very well may use this opportunity to try and break free from the Republic. The consequences of such an action could be grave for the nation, as they might very well attempt to align themselves with our enemies and would provide a perfect base for an invasion of Ireland."

However, now that hostile volunteer forces have joined the Republican forces, it would be fair to say that the civil war in Ireland is not necessarily developing to our advantage. If we were to invest anymore of our own military even as 'volunteers' then it could be seen as a direct act of war by our hostile neighbours in Europe and across the Atlantic.
