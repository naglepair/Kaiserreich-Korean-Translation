### Decisions ###
JBS_SAU_Power_Struggle:0 "통일전쟁 준비"
JBS_SAU_Power_Struggle_desc:0 "Time has not been very kind to the House of Rashid. Losing most of their male family members at the hands of the Ibn Saud and suffering from continous raids into their territory by the Ikhwan, the Rashidi federation of Emirs is cracking under the weight of the Wahabbists. Support by the Ottoman Empire is keeping our dominion on its feet however as their continued partnership and alliance with our Emir ensures his lands are safe. Further reinforced in 1925 when the former British protectorates of the Trucial States, Qatar and Bahrain were placed under our supervision, ties with the Sultan are strong.\n\nNonetheless some have argued that this partnership is the only thing keeping our realm together and should disaster befall the Ottomans, Ibn Saud may see it as his destiny to unite the peninsula under his rule."

JBS_War_of_Unification_desc:0 "The Final Struggle for control over the Arab interior is rapidly approaching as the Ottoman behemoth is crackling under the weight of the worldwide economic depression, temporarily unable to maintain peace on the peninsula. All Emirs will have to pick a side for the future of the Arab world will be written in blood and the losers will find themselves disgraced, cast aside or slain on the field of battle."
JBS_Counter_SAU_UAE:0 "Counter Saudi influence in the Trucial States"
JBS_Counter_SAU_UAE_desc:0 "As our power in the region diminishes, the cronies of Ibn Saud are trying to sway the Emirs of the Trucial States to his banner. Promising riches, weapons, departure of the Turk and the purification of the Islamic faith, many seem to be aligning themselves with him or at least considering his offer.

JBS_Ottoman_Favours_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire, commonly refered to as the Sublime Porte, is our largest ally in the region and also its strongest military.

JBS_Ottoman_Training:0 "Invite Experts from the Erkân-ı Harbiye Mektebi"
JBS_Ottoman_Training_desc:0 "The Ottomans have fought a bloody war with us at their side two decades ago but even then it was clear who had the doctrinal advantage.
