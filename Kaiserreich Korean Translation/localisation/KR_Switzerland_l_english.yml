SWI_combat_economic_crisis_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans for the government to introduce sweeping austerity measures to combat the economic crisis caused by the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange."
SWI_transport_of_goods_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans for the revision of a law that would standardise the transportation of goods and animals on public roads, and would limit this transportation in favour of governmental transport."
SWI_army_reorganization_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans for the reorganisation of the army along the German model. Such a reorganisation would necessitate the invitation of German military advisers and result in temporary disorganisation in the military."
SWI_freemasonry_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans for the banning of secret societies such as Freemasonry and other secret politicised gatherings."
SWI_revise_constitution_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans to grant greater powers to Swiss police forces to arrest and detain without trial, in the interest of maintaining public order, and to combat subversive threats in the nation, such as the threats posed by extremist movements in the Romandie region."
SWI_syndicalist_unions_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans to ban the formation of and participation in unions or other political organisations that follow the Syndicalist manifesto or adhere to strong Syndicalist beliefs. This measure is designed to curb extremist influence in Switzerland and restore stability in the nation."
SWI_language_acts_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans to include Romansch as an official language in Switzerland. Including Romansch as an official language would serve to include those who have previously felt as outcasts into the national government."
SWI_romandy_crisis_desc:0 "Agitated by supporters in the neighbouring French Commune, local Syndicalist revolutionaries in Romandie and Haute-Savoie have made a move against the Swiss national government. This uprising has become internationally known as "The Savoyard Crisis", and how the government reacts to this crisis will shape the future of our nation."
SWI_bend_to_france_desc:0 "Germany has abandoned us, and no other nation has taken up our cause in the face of the French behemoth. Is it not better, then, to join the French rather than be crushed by the Syndicalist tide?"
SWI_enemies_on_all_sides_desc:0 "Germany to the North has betrayed us. France to the West has seized our land. Italy to the South has remained silent. Austria to the East pays us no heed. We are surrounded by enemies and traitors on all sides. The Swiss people have no friends but themselves, and none other."
SWI_german_aid_desc:0 "In the face of outright aggression from the French, Germany has answered our calls for aid and stands firmly with the Swiss people in their stand against Syndicalism. With Germany by our side, we can beat back the French hordes and secure our borders with German aid."
SWI_italian_assisstance_desc:0 "Heeding our call for aid, Italy has stood tall amongst the powers of Europe and declared their support for Switzerland in the Savoyard Crisis. With Italy as our powerful ally, we stand a chance against the French."
SWI_black_spot_of_europe_desc:0 "There is a Black Spot forming in the centre of Europe, where few enter, and few leave. The Swiss people have made their nation an impenetrable fortress bristling with xenophobia and myriad interweaving fortresses, content for now to their self-imposed isolation."
SWI_defend_the_borders_desc:0 "Our borders are in danger of being violated. It is our duty to remind our neighbours that we are a sovereign nation that will not be trampled upon again by an imperialist foreign power."
SWI_referendum_syndicalism_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans to abolish the current Federal Government and reconstitute a new government to be decided upon by the Swiss people, and approved by invited guests from the neighbouring French Commune."
SWI_german_economic_assisstance_desc:0 "Switzerland is not a nation gifted with an abundance of natural resources. Creating a flow of men and materiel from Mitteleuropa to Switzerland will allow us to sustain our fragile economy in the face of French aggression."
SWI_joint_command_desc:0 "Our military command is enthusiastic but green in the field. We must reorganise our command structure to integrate our own forces with the massive German military. This joint command will increase the effectiveness of both nation's armies in the unforgiving Swiss Alps."
SWI_ban_all_foreigners_desc:0 "It is through the corruption of foreign influences that we have found ourselves in this political hole, surrounded on all sides by those who want to seize our lands and destroy our culture. They must be expelled if our nation is to survive."
SWI_abolish_the_verdingkinder_desc:0 "The Verdingkinder, or "Contract Children", are children taken from their loving families and sent to work as slaves for the benefit of fat capitalist corporations. These children must be freed immediately from the capitalist yoke and be re-educated with good Syndicalist values."
SWI_mandatory_service_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply draft the men in defence of Switzerland. The women, the children, the elderly. Our neighbours can field armies of millions, so we too must field an army of equal size to combat these threats."
SWI_gold_reserves_desc:0 "To form the backbone of our new economy, the Swiss Bank's gold reserves must be filled and preserved with large quantities of gold that will anchor our currency for generations to come."
SWI_the_government_has_failed_desc:0 "The current model of the Swiss government has proven wholly weak and ineffective in protecting Switzerland from the vultures that circle her. Drastic governmental reform and a strong leading hand are needed if Switzerland is to continue as a free and independent nation."
SWI_one_people_desc:0 "For too long have the Swiss people bent to the wills of our neighbours and spoken in their tongues. It is time for Switzerland to abandon these foreign languages and only conduct official business in the German language, the one true language of Switzerland."
SWI_swiss_french_alliance_desc:0 "The diplomatic pressure coming from the French Commune is overwhelming, and the other powers of Europe have shown themselves too afraid to stand against the Commune's might. The Syndicalist wave is unstoppable, we are better off bowing to France of our own accord then being swept aside by the inevitable."
SWI_geneva_avenged_desc:0 "Years ago, the brave workers of Geneva stood up for their rights and freedoms, and were brutally struck down by the old capitalist regime. Now we can properly honour those heroes who gave their lives to lay the foundations for the modern Syndicalist Switzerland we know and love today."
SWI_national_defense_desc:0 "The national spirit of Switzerland focuses on a strong defence in the face of foreign invasion. The Swiss people do not fight for imperialist ambitions, but to defend their neighbours and their homes."
SWI_beat_back_french_desc:0 "After securing our position from the National Redoubt, it is time to gather our forces and mount a large counterattack in order to fight the French off of our land. Once beaten back, we can work with our German allies and march into the Commune itself."
SWI_austrian_assisstance_desc:0 "Responding to our calls for aid, our longtime neighbour the Austrian Empire has responded and promised to defend our sovereignty against French aggression. With the aid of a power such as Austria, we are surely capable of holding against the French invaders."
SWI_swiss_miracle_desc:0 "A combination of strong economic policies, a healthy bank stocked with gold, and a dash of luck have combined to birth an economic boom the likes of which Switzerland has never seen. Dubbed "The Swiss Miracle", this spurt of economic growth is exactly what we need to advance our place in the world's hierarchy."
SWI_fortress_desc:0 "Switzerland's defensive mindset centres around a series of mountain fortresses and fortifications that make Switzerland an impenetrable obstacle. This prideful spirit of defence drives our forces onwards to a glorious victory."
SWI_new_government_desc:0 "Over 600 years ago our ancestors gathered on the Rütli to swear the oath of the Swiss Confederacy. Now, on the eve of our rebirth, we must gather representatives from the Unions across Switzerland to swear a new oath, one forming the foundation of the new Syndicalist age."
SWI_national_unions_desc:0 "Outside of Romandie, Syndicalist Unions have failed to make significant gains politically and are struggling with their newfound power. We must support and officially recognise the authority these Unions now have in the government."
SWI_gotthard_desc:0 "Fortress St. Gotthard forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
SWI_maurice_desc:0 "Fortress St. Maurice forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
SWI_Sargans_desc:0 "Fortress Sargans forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
SWI_retreat_redoubt_desc:0 "The betrayal of the Romandie Cantons and the advance of the French forces has put us in an unfavourable position. We cannot hope to hold the line at the border, it is best that our military retreat to our prepared defences in the National Redoubt as we regroup and prepare our counterattack."
SWI_cultivation_battle_desc:0 "Switzerland is not a nation blessed with an abundance of natural resources. For centuries Swiss farmers have fought a battle against the harsh mountain climates to grow enough crops to feed the nation. Now that war looms on the horizon, we must subsidise these farmers to make Switzerland self-sufficient."
SWI_bircher_plan_desc:0 "Colonel Eugen Bircher has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves pursuing a more traditional war with a larger army and a central, mobile force that would seek set-piece battles. Choosing this plan would commit the nation to fighting a war centred around a mobile army with as many offensive moves as defensive."
SWI_guisan_plan_desc:0 "Colonel Henri Guisan has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves a stoic defence and continued usage of the pre-prepared fallback lines and fortresses that would ensure a campaign of guerrilla warfare throughout our nation. Accepting his plan would mean moving forward with a plan to fight a purely defensive war."
SWI_man_borders_desc:0 "We must first activate the civilian Border Guard units and flood our outer defences with soldiers in a show of force against outside aggression. The Swiss people will flock in droves to our defence, and only the staunchest of foes would dare break themselves upon our walls."
SWI_guisan_speech_desc:0 "What the troops need to perform effectively is a strong leader who will lead them through the darkness to victory. Henri Guisan is prepared to be that man, and has gathered a large amount of soldiers to inspire with his words."
SWI_bullet_or_bayonet_desc:0 "If Switzerland is to fall to foreign aggressors, she will not go down without a fight. By bullet or by bayonet the Swiss people will fight for every inch of land and throw our enemies back from our lands."
SWI_resist_to_the_end_desc:0 "Even after the battles are lost and are armies driven from the field, our enemies can not rest easy. It is the duty of the Swiss people to resist in everything they do, and to stop the enemy in every way they can."
SWI_ski_divisions_desc:0 "The Swiss Ski Divisions have a mastery of the Alpine terrain and should be moved into a single, cohesive unit capable of making a decisive strike against our enemies. Properly equipping and expanding these forces will give us a powerful tool to use in the fights to come."
SWI_mountineer_defense_desc:0 "The best defence is a good offence. It is not good enough to simply sit behind or lines. We must make active manoeuvres and strike at the enemy whenever we are given an opportunity, so that we may eventually drive him from our lands entirely."
SWI_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Swiss Air Force has not seen a major change in composition since the end of the Weltkrieg. Our planes are old and decrepit, and in drastic need of an overhaul. We must begin an immediate modernisation of our air force so as not to be left behind."
SWI_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Our continued cooperation with the Germans and integration of our economic and military command structures have pushed us ever closer into the German sphere. Our ties are so great that it seems almost unthinkable to sever our ties with Germany, even if we may desire it. We are already a de facto member of the German sphere, and the time has come to formally join the Reichspakt as a proper member state."
SWI_national_bank_desc:0 "The Swiss National Bank is the strong economic arm of the entire country, handling the finances of the vast majority of the population and the government alike. Subsidising and assisting the bank in its operations, and allowing for bank secrecy when dealing with account holder funds, will serve to boost the economy as we recover from the Black Monday disaster."
SWI_free_our_skies_desc:0 "Our terrestrial defences are strong, but can be easily weakened in the face of enemy air superiority. We should focus heavily on maintaining air superiority in order to keep our enemies at bay."
SWI_swiss_guard_desc:0 "Long since a fixture of the Holy See, our newfound relationship with the Italy has given us opportunity to expand the Papal Guard with experienced and veteran soldiers. Sending these soldiers to the Pope's aid will serve as a fine gesture of goodwill and thanks for standing by us in our time of need."
SWI_alpine_rhine_desc:0 "Our border with Austria is complicated by rivers and mountains that make traversing the terrain slow and difficult. Expansion of these passages between our two nations will enhance the Austrian's ability to send troops and materials to our aid when advancing westwards into the Commune."
SWI_economic_routes_desc:0 "The conflict with France has severed many of our traditional routes of supply. As a landlocked nation, we rely heavily on land routes through friendly nations in order to receive the resources we need for survival. We must expand these network in order to fuel our war effort and maintain the flow of goods."
SWI_new_fighters_desc:0 "It is not enough to copy the designs of other nation's militaries. Funding a new initiative to design a truly Swiss fighter will reduce our dependence on foreign militaries for supplies and equipment."
SWI_international_aid_desc:0 "Our own forces are insufficient, but we hold the moral high ground in this obviously unwarranted conflict. By pleading with every nation that will listen for aid, maybe we can scrape together enough assistance to turn the tide."
SWI_formalize_volunteers_desc:0 "With a new flow of foreign volunteers established, it is now only a matter of organising this trickle of able-bodied men into cohesive fighting units. Mixing these volunteer units with proper Swiss soldiers will strengthen their backbone and improve their organisation the battlefield."
SWI_hold_the_line_desc:0 "Even without a world power on our side, we must still find a way to hold the line against the French aggressors. We cannot win alone, so we must use every advantage available to us to survive long enough for foreign intervention to save the day."
SWI_german_military_tactics_desc:0 "Joining our military command with Germany's has taught us that our own military tactics are woefully behind the times. The new doctrine of the German Army can be taught to our troops in order to bring our troops up to our Ally's standards."
SWI_mountain_airfields_desc:0 "The lofty peaks of the Swiss Alps provide many areas for us to construct new airfields for military use. The altitude of these airfields will make them difficult for the enemy to seize or destroy in war."
SWI_air_academy_desc:0 "Our air force is lacking in trained pilots and serviceable planes. In light of this crisis, we must take advantage of every possible plane we can get our hands on. One proposition is to nationalise all civilian planes and recruit their pilots, mechanics, and radiomen into our own air force."
SWI_cross_the_border_desc:0 "We should look to use our air force not only as a defensive force, but also as a force capable of striking deep into enemy territory. Performing these cross-border raids into enemy territory will let our enemies know that we are capable of more than simple defensive actions."
SWI_mountain_aa_desc:0 "The mountainous terrain of the Alps creates a multitude of areas where we can create new defensive AA emplacements to defend our skies. Such a network of emplaced defences will make any air force rethink their plans to invade our airspace."
SWI_new_swiss_army_desc:0 "Through reform and new military leadership, the Swiss Army of today is all but unrecognisable compared to the army that marched in drill but a few short years ago. This new army is tough, veteran, and ready to take on the world."
SWI_coal_mines_desc:0 "The National Coal Mines provide the strong economic foundation on which the Swiss economy is built. Expanding their operations will increase our economic output exponentially."
SWI_reverse_economic_downturn_desc:0 "After the disastrous hit to our economy that was Black Monday, it has become clear the government needs to take immediate action in order to save the Swiss economy from suffering a complete meltdown."
SWI_war_profiteering_desc:0 "Our neighbour's losses are our gains. Selling weapons to our neighbours as they kill each other in senseless conflict can only serve to strengthen our own position when the time comes to fight."
SWI_economic_sufficiency_desc:0 "All aspects of the Swiss economy rely heavily on foreign imports in order to survive. We must work to move as many industries as possible inside of our own borders to reduce our reliance on foreign powers and encourage our economy to rely on internal sources for production."
SWI_liscense_foregin_designs_desc:0 "Foreign aircraft have proven to be deadly and effective in recent wars. Our own aircraft industry is in its infancy. Perhaps the best idea is to instead licence foreign designs rather than having to spend valuable resources researching our own Swiss aircraft."
SWI_trans_alpine_tunnels_desc:0 "The tunnels running beneath the Alps form a powerful economic lifeline that cross through the centre of Europe. Expanding these tunnels will increase our ability to profit from our control of these railways."
SWI_promote_franc_desc:0 "The economic systems of our neighbours have seen disastrous free falls in the wake of Black Monday. This has affected the strengths of their currencies, and confidence in the financial markets has fallen. Promoting the Swiss franc as the viable alternative to the failing German mark will serve to boost our own economy in the face of this economic crisis."
SWI_sell_war_bonds_desc:0 "Promotion of the Swiss Franc has begun boosting our economy, but the government is still heavily in debt. We must turn to the people in order to support the government in the face of war."
SWI_strategic_services_desc:0 "As a small nation in the centre of Europe, we cannot hope to win on strength alone. We must found a new intelligence service that can solve our problems before they can snowball out of control, and give us powerful intelligence on the moves of our enemies."
SWI_electronics_research_desc:0 "Developed as a replacement for the ageing German ciphers used by the Swiss Army prior to the Second Weltkrieg, the NEMA represents the nation's interests in ensuring that no other nation no matter how friendly, can read our mail."
SWI_issues_of_the_day_desc:0 "For many issues of public importance in Switzerland, the people are allowed to vote in nation-wide referendums, where the outcome is determined by popular vote. Focusing our efforts on these issues will ensure that we tackle the societal problems that people find important in their daily lives."
SWI_vienna_circle_desc:0 "The Austrians have recently made overtures to other nations close to them to participate in the Vienna Circle, a centre of technological advancement and learning in the heart of the Austrian Empire. Joining such a programme would no doubt allow us to enjoy the fruit of these technological advancements."
SWI_strengthen_ties_desc:0 "Our continued relationship with Austria in our fight against Syndicalism is the lifeline keeping our nation from total collapse. We must make moves to ensure that this relationship holds for as long as we face a common foe."
SWI_an_official_alliance_desc:0 "While we are de-facto in an alliance with our wartime ally Austria, it has become necessary to make the alliance a formal relationship. Austria commands the loyalty of a larger network of nations, and joining this web as a formal participant can only serve to strengthen our position."
SWI_german_tech_sharing_desc:0 "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society is Germany's foremost centre of technological advancements and research. Applying for membership in such a prestigious collaboration effort will improve our ability to field a technologically advanced military force."
SWI_never_again_desc:0 "The Geneva Strikes of the early 1930s were caused by a failing and inefficient government. We have made steps to reform that government, but there are many who seek protections against such a tragedy ever occurring again. Thus the Syndicalist Unions are to be given their own military powers, so that the power rests solely in the hands of the Trade Unions."
SWI_the_peoples_republic_desc:0 "The people of Switzerland have made their wills clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by a government too strong for its own good, and too disconnected from the people, wallowing in its capitalist greed. Thus a new government must be formed, a government run solely by the people, and for the people."
SWI_totalitarian_regime_desc:0 "The people of Switzerland have made their will clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by lack of protection from foreign influences. The common people cannot defend against such aggression by themselves. Thus a strong state is necessary to safeguard the nation's future. Georges Oltramare and his Totalist Union Nationale party offer this necessary future."
SWI_loyalty_to_the_state_desc:0 "We must encourage loyalty to the state whenever possible, so that we may foster both a populace and a military that values the strength of the government and its ability to protect the people."
SWI_consolidate_power_desc:0 "There are dissenting voices still within the government and in the streets that oppose the takeover of the government by loyal nationalist forces. These voices are muted, for now, but a consolidation is necessary if we are to identify and "rectify" those who still have misguided views on the government in Switzerland."
SWI_fortress_defense_desc:0 "If our enemies are so keen to attack us in our homes, then we will make such a network of interconnected fortifications that the very idea of assaulting Switzerland will fill the enemy with dread, as the imagine the many millions it will take to gain even a single kilometre of our land."
SWI_expansionist_military_desc:0 "Only through show of arms can we secure our nation's future. To this end, it is important that we instil a strong sense of national pride in all citizens of the nation, so that they will fight to the bitter end to defend their home and their state."
SWI_nuclear_program_desc:0 "The Study Commission for Nuclear Energy's purpose is to investigate the use of both nuclear power in providing for our nation's energy needs, and to evaluate the requirements for the advancement of a weaponised nuclear programme for the defence of the nation."
SWI_uranium_mine_desc:0 "Switzerland is a small state compared to the titans of Europe. Thus we find it necessary to defend ourselves with all means available to us, even if we must bathe the continent in nuclear fire to achieve our goals."
SWI_expand_our_operations_desc:0 "With the world falling to chaos, the Military Intelligence Service must be called upon again and again to undertake more dangerous and more dubious tasks to defend the nation. Expanding their areas of influence and operational capacities will help them resolve whatever problem comes their way. No matter how unsavoury."
SWI_motorization_desc:0 "Our military is almost entirely composed of foot infantry and horse-drawn support. Our troops are slow to move and our supplies even slower to arrive. It is important that we invest in motorisation to keep our troops from fighting the next war with the last war's equipment."
SWI_armor_experiments_desc:0 "The Nahkampfkanone, an experimental Swiss AT Destroyer, has shown great promise in its initial field tests. This project has shown that we are capable of designing our own armoured vehicles, and that we should continue to invest in similar projects."
SWI_mechanized_desc:0 "Our initial motorisation efforts have proved most successful, but there is still more to do. In Germany, new mechanised Panzergrenadiers have begun to show promise as the fighting force of the future, and it is only wise that we follow in their footsteps and invest in our own mechanised forces."
SWI_new_academy_desc:0 "In the interwar period, our fighters relied on an informal school of training that involved local instructors and wildly differing levels of competence. Now that the Air Force is being reformed into a strong and professional force, we must take care to standardise our pilot training school to improve the quality of our pilots nationwide."
SWI_new_tactics_desc:0 "Bambini-Code is a brevity code recently developed to allow for easy communication between our fighter squadrons in the heat of combat. Its use has proven wildly effective, and promoting and requiring its use among our pilots will drastically improve their ability to perform against their counterparts."
SWI_bombers_desc:0 "The establishment of the Surveillance Squadrons will allow us to gain intelligence through fighter patrols in and around our borders while also maintaining a large nighttime presence."
SWI_air_factories_desc:0 "Flugzeugwerk Emmen is the nation's first dedicated aircraft factory, and is designed to construct the first of many planes in the Swiss Air Force."
SWI_strategic_bombing_desc:0 "The acceleration of our previous raiding campaigns have taught us that if we are to continue, we must invest in large strategic bombing forces. These forces will allow us to project our power across the continent while maintaining our air force entirely within the confines of Switzerland."
SWI_defensive_constructions_desc:0 "Our previous projects have given us extensive experience and knowledge in the proper construction and design of fortifications. We can take advantage of this knowledge and create new defensive networks wherever they are needed."
SWI_new_roadways_desc:0 "Our nation is one with twisting roadways and extensive railways that connect cities separated by large mountain ranges. It is important that we update and maintain our extensive rail networks so that we may move goods and soldiers around the nation as easily as possible. Electrifying tour rail lines with power from our hydroelectric dams will ensure they run as efficiently as possible."
SWI_develop_cantons_desc:0 "We must make a concerted effort to develop all regions of the nation equally. To this end, we must allow the Cantons autonomy in their own development and construction of infrastructure, as well as to empower the Bureau of Mining of the Federal War, Industry and Employment Office to create a national survey of the nation's natural resources for exploitation."
SWI_canton_improvement_desc:0 "Switzerland is a nation with few national resources of its own. Swiss Steel is one of the few Steel corporations operating inside of the country. If Switzerland is to become self-sufficient in Steel production, we will need to fund their efforts."
SWI_swiss_seas_desc:0 "Switzerland is a traditionally landlocked nation with no direct access to the high seas, however, this does not prevent us from fielding a fleet of our own. Whether it is a militarised navy or one of maritime commerce, the Swiss will sail the seas as proud as any other nation on earth."
SWI_military_factories_desc:0 "Oerlikon-Bührle is the largest producer of arms and artillery in the nation. Their weapons constitute almost half of our nations arms exports, and giving them valued government subsidies will not only increase their productivity but ensure our soldiers are equipped with the highest quality weapons."
SWI_final_factories_desc:0 "The war is becoming a large drain on our stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Our trade with foreign powers is not only insufficient, but unreliable. We must transition not only our industrial quarters but all parts of our society to a war footing if we are to produce enough weapons to last the conflict."
SWI_expanding_the_shipyards_desc:0 "Our military adventures have found us currently in possession of several large shipyards. Theses shipyards, the first in our nation's history, could be used to produce the large blue water navy that the Swiss people have only ever dreamed of."
SWI_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Investing into a strong military navy would be a waste. By the time hostilities have ended, our navy will still be in its infancy. Meanwhile, we could instead use this time to invest heavily into our merchant marine, whose voyages could directly impact our international trade and bring back tidy profits."
SWI_military_navy_desc:0 "Rather than wasting our time focusing on trade, we should instead use our new naval facilities to facilitate the creation of a completely new Swiss Navy, one which can fight the navies of the other world powers."
SWI_seaborne_trade_routes_desc:0 "The Swiss economy is on an upswing that will last it for years to come. Now that we have sea access, it is our best interests to keep this momentum and begin investing into nautical trade routes to expand our wealth."
SWI_center_of_commerce_desc:0 "Our continued investment into the merchant marine and maritime trade, combined with the strong state of the Swiss economy, has allowed our ports to be known as strong centres of trade worldwide, with the economic gains from these cities flowing freely into our treasury."
SWI_independent_navy_desc:0 "The Lakes Flotilla of Switzerland now finds itself in possession of all of the facilities and materiel necessary to form a proper naval force. This newly created Swiss Navy must quickly adapt itself to combat on the high seas, or be sunk in the process."
SWI_naval_bombers_desc:0 "A combination of research into traditional bomber forces and naval innovations, the new Swiss naval bombers will drastically increase our ability to project power across the waves."
SWI_coastal_defense_desc:0 "While we move forward with our transition to a fully blue water navy, it is still of vital importance that we support the Lakes Flotilla, for they protect the waterways in and around Switzerland from outside aggression."
SWI_naval_officers_desc:0 "Switzerland's naval activities in previous years has consisted only of merchant marine sailors and the brown water Lakes Flotilla. We must take these few experienced men we can, and use them to train the next generation of proud Swiss sailors for our navy."
SWI_ship_designs_desc:0 "While we have come into the possession of new naval facilities, a first for this formerly landlocked state, we cannot move forward with a fleet without first investing in ship designs. Switzerland's naval tradition is small, and thus we must move forward to design a new fleet of ships as soon as possible to begin our training."
SWI_first_vessel_desc:0 "After several gruelling months of work, it is time for great celebration as the Swiss Navy officially christens its first ocean going naval vessel. The EKS Helvetia is the first of many in the new Swiss Fleet, and will serve as our first flagship as the Swiss Navy joins the great oceangoing fleets of this age."
SWI_beneath_the_waves_desc:0 "While we have found ourselves in possession of large naval facilities and dockyards, it is not feasible to create a large traditional fleet. Instead we should focus on cheap and efficient submarines, so that we can project power without the decades-long investments a surface fleet requires."
SWI_surface_fleet_desc:0 "Our nation was formerly a landlocked state, one that could not properly project its power on the high seas. Now we find ourselves in the possession of multiple dockyards, and as an ascendant naval power. It is our duty to create a surface fleet that can go toe-to-toe with the old powers."
SWI_peace_at_last_desc:0 "We have made it through the Savoyard Crisis with no Swiss blood being shed. We have realised that violence is not always the answer, and maintaining our neutrality in the face of conflict is what makes us strong. We can move forward from this crisis as a newer and stronger nation."
SWI_french_mission_desc:0 "The source of the crisis in Haute-Savoie was our extremely sour relations with our large neighbour, the Commune of France. We have had poor relations for over a decade, and it is time for this era of rivalry to end. We will send a diplomatic mission to Paris to try and hammer out a diplomatic solution to our confrontations and try and befriend France, rather than fight them."
SWI_embrace_neutrality_desc:0 "The Swiss people are known far and wide as a people who value the strength of neutrality. Having survived the Savoyard Crisis without surrendering our values, we have proven that neutrality is a virtue. We should embrace this philosophy across the nation."
SWI_beacon_of_peace_desc:0 "Switzerland has been through a series of tough trials and impending crises, and has stood tall through all of them. Even as nations around us fight and squabble over their totalitarian empires, we stand tall in the middle of Europe and as a burning beacon of peace and prosperity in the middle of the storm."
SWI_unity_through_conquest_desc:0 "It is not by hiding in our homes and bracing for the coming tides that we shall weather the storm. It is by taking what is and has always been rightfully ours. The people must be united behind a common cause, and this cause is to take what our enemies have stolen from us."

In the ensuing violence 13 were killed and over 100 injured in Geneva. This has left a bitter divide between the Romandie and Bern which over the subsequent years has failed to heal."

### Events ###
swiss.1.t:0 "기장의 연설"
swiss.1.d:0 "It was a wonderful sunny day when Henri Guisan made his speech not only to all of the soldiers and officers in attendance, but to the whole of Switzerland. In his speech he praised the strength and unity of the Swiss people, and promised that victory was not only attainable, but assured. \nAs Guisan finished giving his lengthy and beautifully worded speech, he was greeted with thunderous applause from all in attendance. This will surely go down in Swiss history as a historic event."
swiss.1.a:0 "Inspirational to us all."
swiss.2.t:0 "군이 모이다"
swiss.2.d:0 "Switzerland has maintained its neutrality in conflict for hundreds of years. We are a people that hold fast to our values of neutrality and peace. But now we find ourselves embroiled in a conflict for our very survival. The men are scared and many are unsure if they are capable of fighting at all. Seeing this weakness among the soldiers, Henri Guisan has decided to hold a large rally on the Rütli, the historic location of the Rütlischwur of 1291. All Swiss officers are to be in attendance, and the speech is to be made to inspire Swiss people across the nation."
swiss.2.a:0 "We await Guisan's speech."
swiss.3.t:0 "국민 투표: 공용어"
swiss.3.d:0 "Enough political capital has been raised to institute an official referendum today on an important topic to the Swiss people. The issue of whether or not to include Romansch as a national language of Switzerland is what is to be decided. If voted in, this predominantly Swiss language would join the likes of French, German, and Italian among Switzerland's national languages. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.3.a:0 "하지 않는다."

swiss.7.t:0 "국민 투표: 연방 헌법 개정"
swiss.7.d:0 "There has been increasing support recently for increasing powers of the state to arrest and detain subversive actors in the nation with increased authority. This move is seen as necessary by many who have seen the escalating rift between French West and German East inside of the country, and believe that many extremist movements, on the right and left, are forming an increasingly large threat to the stability of the nation. Many opponents believe that it will only be a stopgap measure, and that a conflict between the government and extremist movements is inevitable. Should we support this referendum?"

swiss.15.t:0 "국민 투표: 생디칼리스트 연합 금지"
swiss.15.d:0 "It is no secret that Syndicalism has been spreading constantly over recent years inside of the nation. It shares a large border with the Syndicalist Commune of France, and the pains of the Geneva Massacre still fester in Romandie. This referendum is an extreme measure to combat this crisis at the root, and ban the Syndicalist Unions from the nation entirely.

swiss.17.a:0 "Wonderful!"
swiss.18.t:0 "생디칼리스트 연합 투표 통과 실패"
swiss.18.d:0 "It seems that Syndicalist support was too strong, and the referendum has failed. Syndicalists will continue to meet as they have done over the past few years."
swiss.18.a:0 "The people did not support it."
swiss.19.t:0 "국민 투표: 군대 재조직"
swiss.19.d:0 "It has become clear that the old structure of the Swiss army is no longer fit for the coming years. Previously, the military has relied on strong reserve of quickly-trained volunteers in order to form the backbone of the army when in need, but the rise of strong professional armies all around Switzerland has made this model seem obsolete. This referendum proposes that we reform the army along the German model, and create a strong and professional standing force. Should we support this referendum?"

swiss.22.a:0 "The people did not support it."
swiss.23.t:0 "국민 투표: 프리메이슨리의 지위"
swiss.23.d:0 "Freemasonry has come into the public spotlight recently for its supposed connection to dangerous extremist movements and the prevalence of its members among higher levels of office. Freemasons are not believed by the state to be a real danger, but who really knows with such secretive societies? The public will have to say whether they are allowed to continue their practice within our borders. Should we support this referendum?"

swiss.25.d:0 "The referendum has passed, and Freemasons have been barred from official meetings inside the nation. While there is likely little effect on the day-to-day of the government's operation, the public's support of the state has risen with the news."
swiss.25.a:0 "Wonderful!"
swiss.26.t:0 "프리메이슨 국민투표 통과 실패"

Hand-picked military units held important locations throughout the capital and the rest of the nation, and not a single shot was fired, nor a single life lost.\n\nThe previous government's failure to both protect the Swiss people in Romandie and secure foreign assistance against such a move had made it obvious to the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband that the current government has failed completely, and only an entirely new government could hope to revitalise the Swiss nation.\n\nOne only hopes that their nationalistic tendencies can be kept in check."

swiss.90.d:0 "Officer Louis de Montmollin, after being declared innocent in the Bern Trials months before, has today been reported to have fled over the border into the Commune of France. He took with him several like-minded officers who either escaped arrest or were declared innocent in the trials, along with crucial information on our military deplomyments against the French.\n\nThe whole affiar is seen as an embarrasment for the regime in Bern and many are wondering if the military are truly in control."
swiss.90.a:0 "We were fools to trust him."
swiss.91.t:0 "소용없는 숙청"
swiss.91.d:0 "After the widely publicized show trials in Bern, the government has almost nothing to show for their efforts. We failed to prosecute any officers of note, and the people have taken us to be utter buffoons. How could we hold such trials and make no convictions?"
swiss.91.a:0 "We look like fools."
swiss.92.t:0 "New Generation of Officers"
swiss.92.d:0 "Months have passed, and a new generation of officers loyal to the state have entered the military. Month by month, the effects of the Bern Trials on our military effecitveness fade."
swiss.92.a:0 "Loyal officers are good officers."
swiss.93.t:0 "스위스 장교들이 전향하다"
swiss.93.d:0 "After the end of the Savoyard Crisis, the Swiss government to our east was quickly overthrown by pro-German military officers who felt that the government had failed them. Paranoid and angry at French-speaking Swiss for 'betraying' their nation, they quickly began purging French elements of their military structure.\n\nThis approach has obviously backfired, as today a group of former Swiss officers fled over the border into France, seeking asylum from their oppressive government. They bring with them many secret Swiss military documents, which will surely be of use to us."
swiss.93.a:0 "Welcome, brothers."

swiss.100.t:0 "기억이 잊히다"
swiss.100.d:0 "With the bloodless resolution of the crisis in Haute-Savoie, Syndicalist agitations within the borders of our nation have faded. Old grudges have begun to be forgotten and a new period of unity is dawning. Those who remain as Syndicalist supporters have mostly begun resorting to more peaceable forms of political activism, and the political tension that once gripped the country is no more."
swiss.100.a:0 "We are brothers."
swiss.101.t:0 "France Loses Interest"
swiss.101.d:0 "Despite increasing tensions between ourselves and the French commune over the status of Haute-Savoie, today we have learned that the French government has suddenly dropped all plans to incense activism inside of Switzerland. It seems that the government in Paris has become dissuaded from pursuing the matter further, content to simply rattle its saber. We have dodged what could have become a major international crisis."
swiss.101.a:0 "Luck is on our side."
swiss.102.t:0 "Backstabbed!"
swiss.102.d:0 "Despite an initial promise of assistance against the French Commune, our ally has instead reversed that promise and instead publicly declared non-interference against this imperialist land-grab by the French Commune! It seems that our ally wanted to call France's bluff, but when France did not back down, they fled from the fight like the cowards they are. We are all alone in the world."
swiss.102.a:0 "Damn them all!"
swiss.103.t:0 "사보이 위기가 진정되다"
swiss.103.d:0 "For many months, the regions of Romandie and Haute-Savoie have been gripped by tension as Swiss socialists have petitioned the Commune of France for annexation and intervention in order to unite the French speaking peoples under one banner. However, it appears that despite initial threats against the stability of the Swiss nation, no intervention seems forthcoming from the Commune. Lacking a serious supporter and seemingly acting against the wishes of the greater Swiss nation, today Syndicalist leaders have met with the Federal government for what appears to be the first of many negotiations to end the hostilities. It seems that peace has won the day, the crisis is over."
swiss.103.a:0 "Peace reigns."
swiss.104.t:0 "사보이 위기가 진정되다"
swiss.104.d:0 "Despite the earlier opportunity to support the French-speaking regions of Switzerland against their capitalist oppressors, we have not found supporting their movement in our best interests. Now news has come from Switzerland that Syndicalist revolutionaries in the nation, disheartened at our lack of support, have decided to enter formal negotiations with the Swiss federal government. Whatever comes of these talks, our chance to intervene has passed."
swiss.104.a:0 "An opportunity lost."
swiss.105.t:0 "Diplomatic Mission to the Commune"
swiss.105.d:0 "Now that the crisis in Haute-Savoie has passed without bloodshed, there are many who have seen the extreme dangers of having an unfriendly power such as the Commune of France right on our border. The Federal Government has decided the only way to rectify this situation is to improve bilateral relations between ourselves and the French. An diplomatic mission has been sent to the Commune to attempt to defuse the hostilities."
swiss.105.a:0 "Let's make the attempt."
swiss.106.t:0 "Diplomatic Mission from Switzerland"
swiss.106.d:0 "Swiss diplomats arrived today in Paris to discuss the state of relations between our two countries. Previously our two states were on opposite sides of the Savoyard Crisis, but now that the crisis is behind us, it seems that the Swiss are eager to get in our good graces."
swiss.106.a:0 "Let's negotiate."
swiss.106.b:0 "Swiss? We have no need of the Swiss."
swiss.107.t:0 "Turned Away from Paris"
swiss.107.d:0 "Despite the earnest efforts of our diplomatic team to the French Commune, the French seem unwilling to negotiate with us on restoring friendly relations. We will have to remain vigilant on our shared border."
swiss.107.a:0 "A shame."
swiss.108.t:0 "Extracting Concessions"
swiss.108.d:0 "As the Swiss are more damaged by our poor bilateral relations, it is possible that they will agree to concessions in exchange for economic cooperation and the lifting of trade sanctions.\n\nOn the other hand, asking for too much threatens to leave the negotiations entirely. Should we make demands?"
swiss.108.a:0 "Demand the return of Haute-Savoie."
swiss.108.b:0 "Demand the concession of French Romandie."

swiss.109.d:0 "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by the concession of Haute-Savoie to the Commune. The Commune has declared that as the one and only legal French government, we are obligated to return Haute-Savoie under the terms of the Congress of Vienna. How should we respond?"
swiss.109.a:0 "We must accept."

swiss.110.d:0 "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer. They will negotiate in good faith, but any negotiations must be preceded by the cession of Romandie to the Commune.

swiss.111.d:0 "After some initial negotiations, the French have come to us with an offer.

swiss.111.a:0 "We must accept."
swiss.111.b:0 "No!"
swiss.111.c:0 "This is outrageous! We're leaving!"

swiss.113.t:0 "The Swiss are Outraged"
swiss.113.d:0 "The Swiss response to our demands was one of complete shock. After hours of quiet discussion in private, the delegation has decided that our demands were simply insulting and belied an unwillingness to properly negotiate.\n\nThe entire delegation left soon after, and do not seem intent on returning for another round of talks."
swiss.113.a:0 "Negotiations have broken down..."
swiss.114.t:0 "Rejection of our Demands"
swiss.114.d:0 "In response to our demands, the Swiss have soundly rejected any sort of concessions, and seem unwilling to consider the negotiations if concessions are on the table.\n\nThey are unlikely to back down on this stance."
swiss.114.a:0 "They called our bluff. We will cooperate without concessions."
swiss.114.b:0 "No concessions, no negotiations."
swiss.115.t:0 "France Expels our Diplomats"
swiss.115.d:0 "We have informed the French negotiators that we are unwilling to continue negotiations if the French are going to demand concessions. In response, the French have expelled our delegation and halted negotiations. There will be no deal with the French."
swiss.115.a:0 "Unfortunate."
swiss.116.t:0 "The nature of our Cooperation?"
swiss.116.d:0 "After agreeing to the initial French demands, the ball is now in our court. Rather than simply restoring relations, it is possible that Switzerland and France can work together and create a relationship that will benefit us both. What sort of relationship should we pursue?"

swiss.120.a:0 "The political freeze is over."
swiss.121.t:0 "Switzerland Recognizes the Commune"
swiss.121.d:0 "We have received news that as part of a negotiated deal with the Commune of France, the Swiss government has officially recognized the Commune of France as the legitimate French government.

swiss.121.a:0 "Damn them!"
swiss.122.t:0 "Peace with the Commune?"
swiss.122.d:0 "We have gone to war in defence of the small Swiss nation against the Commune of France. Initially, we had hoped to hold the French at the border, and force them into a negotiated peace that would ensure the integrity of the Swiss nation.\n\nThis plan has failed, and as we speak enemies march into Austria itself!

swiss.123.t:0 "Austria Sues for Peace"
swiss.123.d:0 "Our war of liberation against Switzerland and their Austrian allies is going well. So well, in fact, that the Austrians have come to us with an offer of peace.

How should we respond?"

swiss.125.t:0 "An Offer of A Harsh Peace"
swiss.125.d:0 "France has responded to our request for a negotiated peace by offering us harsh terms. We will be forced to cut all ties with the Italian Republic, and be forced to cede some land to France's new regime in former Switzerland. Switzerland itself will be left to suffer whatever fate the Commune dreams for it. We will pay minor economic reparations for our part in the war.\n\nConsidering our military situation, it seems like a decent offer..."
swiss.125.a:0 "We Accept."
swiss.125.b:0 "These terms are unacceptable!"
swiss.126.t:0 "No Peace!"
swiss.126.d:0 "The French have completely refused to negotiate any sort of peace with us, stating that the only peace we will receive is one dictated to us from our own halls in Vienna. The French will not negotiate with us."

swiss.127.t:0 "Austria Accepts White Peace"
swiss.127.d:0 "The Austrians were all to eager to accept our offer of a white peace, even if it means leaving the Swiss to their fate. Peace will be signed with the Austrians, and we will have a free hand to do as we like with the Swiss."
swiss.127.a:0 "A wise choice."
swiss.128.t:0 "Austrian Betrayal"
swiss.128.d:0 "The war was certainly not going well, but the latest news from Vienna is simply shocking. The Austrians have signed a peace agreement with the French. And even worse, they have agreed to let the French do as they will with our nation. It seems as though this is the end for our nation..."
swiss.128.a:0 "Enemies on all sides!"
swiss.129.t:0 "Our Terms Rejected"
swiss.129.d:0 "Despite being the nation to initiate the process of peace, the Austrians have rejected the terms we so politely offered them, and instead have insisted on seeing this war to its conclusion.\n\nThey will soon know the error of their ways."
swiss.129.a:0 "War it is, then."
swiss.130.t:0 "Austria Surrenders"
swiss.130.d:0 "Austria, seeing the dire situation they are in, have accepted our most generous terms and will cede all of the territory we have requested of them. In addition, Switzerland has been abandoned to its fate and is ours to do with as we please.\n\nOur allies the Socialist Republic of Italy will be most ecstatic to hear this news."
swiss.130.a:0 "A nice bonus."
swiss.131.t:0 "Austria and Italy"
swiss.131.d:0 "Unbeknownst to us, the Austrians and French have been engaged in a series of peace talks regarding our current conflict over Switzerland. A peace deal has been reached, and France has secured us an agreement which will see the Austrians revoking all support from their pathetic puppet Italian Republic. It is only a matter of time before that false state flounders without its puppet master's strings."
swiss.131.a:0 "A true ally."
swiss.132.t:0 "Austrian Evacuation"
swiss.132.d:0 "Unbeknownst to us, the Austrians and French have been engaged in a series of peace talks regarding our current conflict over Switzerland. A peace deal has been reached, and the Austrians have not come out on top. As a part of the agreement, they will be forced to sever all ties with us, essentially leaving us to be swallowed by the Socialist Republic of Italy. Times are grim."
swiss.132.a:0 "Damn."
swiss.133.t:0 "Swiss-Germans Flee Syndicalist Rule"
swiss.133.d:0 "With the new Syndicalist regime seizing control of Switzerland, there are many who have something to fear from the changing of the guard. Thousands of Swiss, fearing Syndicalist reprisals, have fled over the border into Germany seeking the protection of the German Empire."
swiss.133.a:0 "We didn't need them."
swiss.134.t:0 "Swiss Refugees"
swiss.134.d:0 "With the Swiss government overthrown by Syndicalist rebels, there is chaos in many predominantly German cities in Switzerland. Many, fearing punitive action from the new government, have fled across the border into Germany and are seeking the protection of the Kaiser from the Syndicalist menace."
swiss.134.a:0 "Welcome them."
swiss.135.t:0 "The Red Cross"
swiss.135.d:0 "The Second Weltkrieg has begun, and the Red Cross, based in Geneva, has begun to organise in response to the predicted casualties. The Red Cross will help both sides in the war, taking no sides, and surely countless lives will be saved by their efforts.\n\nIn the last war, Red Cross societies delivered tens of millions of letters and parcels, sent out millions of Francs in aid, facilitated the transfer of hundreds of thousands of prisoners, and saved countless lives.\n\nLet us hope that they will not need to do as much in this war."
swiss.135.a:0 "War is hell."
swiss.136.t:0 "Defeat in Switzerland?"
swiss.136.d:0 "In what was widely considered by the High Command to be a quick and easy war, we have found ourselves on the back foot in our fight against the Swiss and their Austrian defenders. In order to save face in the international community, many have suggested we sue for peace immediately before our ineptitude on the battlefield becomes internationally observed."
swiss.136.a:0 "Sue for peace."
swiss.136.b:0 "Never!"
swiss.137.t:0 "France Begs for Mercy"
swiss.137.d:0 "There are high spirits all around as a French delegation arrived today with the intent to negotiate a peace between our two nations. It is no secret that the war is going very poorly for the French, and they are surely eager to end the war as soon as possible.\n\nThis would be a great opportunity to demand more out of them..."
swiss.137.a:0 "Peace is enough."
swiss.137.b:0 "Seize the rest of Savoie."
swiss.137.c:0 "We're marching to Paris!"
swiss.138.t:0 "Switzerland Accepts White Peace"
swiss.138.d:0 "Switzerland has responded favorably to our request for a settled peace, it seems that they are as eager to end the war as we are. All land gained or lost during the course of the conflict is to be returned to its original owner, and both sides are to return and lick their wounds. The war is over."
swiss.138.a:0 "We got off easy."
swiss.139.t:0 "Switzerland Demands Savoie"
swiss.139.d:0 "The Swiss are willing to accept our offer of peace, but only on the condition that we hand over stewardship of the rest of the Savoie region. They do have a legal claim to the region, dating back to 1815 and the Congress of Vienna, but this is an obviously opportunistic land grab.\n\nHowever, in our current situation, we are not in a position to refuse their demand. They could certainly have demanded worse..."
swiss.139.a:0 "We have no choice."
swiss.140.t:0 "Switzerland Refuses Peace"
swiss.140.d:0 "Despite our generous offer of peace in the face of the Swiss advance, we have received news that the Swiss are refusing any and all offers of peace. It seems that the mad Swiss are so confident in their invincibility that they think they can defeat the whole Commune. We will take pleasure in destroying these fools."
swiss.140.a:0 "They are overconfident buffoons."
swiss.141.t:0 "Peace with France!"
swiss.141.d:0 "News has arrived today that Switzerland has reached a negotiated peace with France. This is a victory for both ourselves and the Swiss, the Syndicalist menace has shown its weakness for all the world to see!"

swiss.142.d:0 "We have come out victorious in the war against France! The people are cheering in the streets and parades are being held in honour of our victorious troops all around the nation. It is time to celebrate!"
swiss.142.a:0 "A hard fought peace."
swiss.143.t:0 "Occupation of Haute-Savoie"
swiss.143.d:0 "In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna Switzerland was given the legal right to maintain the neutrality of Haute-Savoie in exchange for relinquishing all official claims on the region. During the Weltkrieg, as France was falling to Syndicalist revolutionaries, the Swiss government found it necessary to send soldiers to protect the region from the chaotic violence of the time.\n\nShortly after, the true French government was exiled to Africa, and Switzerland has maintained her military occupation of the region until a time that France returns to the mainland to reclaim it.\n\nThis of course has not sat well with the current government in Paris, which has actively attempted to reclaim the province."
swiss.143.a:0 "We will fulfill our legal mandate."
swiss.144.t:0 "KKP and BGB Leave the Bourgeois Block"
swiss.144.d:0 "The Bourgeois Block, the informal alliance of the popular Market Liberal FDP with the BGB and KKP conservative parties, has long stood as the most stalwart of Swiss political institutions, working to ensure that conservative interests are satisfied and that aggressive Radical Socialist and Syndicalist parties remain marginalised. Today that relationship was severed as the Catholic-Conservative Party (KKP) and the Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents (BGB) announced their loss of confidence in FDP's ability to handle the economy in the wake of the Black Monday disaster.\n\nWith Switzerland's greatest political parties beginning to fight amongst themselves rather than against socialism, there will be room for smaller parties to make their move."

swiss.145.t:0 "Swiss National Day"

swiss.145.a:0 "Go us!"
swiss.146.t:0 "Eugen Bircher speaks against Syndicalists"
swiss.146.d:0 "Eugen Bircher, influential Colonel in the Swiss military, today made a speech in front of the National Council wherein he plead with the council to 'slay the beast' that was the Syndicalist movements spreading within the nation.\n\nEugen Bircher leads the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband, a paramilitary pro-German society that has been gaining influence among prominent Swiss military officers and politicians.\n\nThe colonel has been increasingly vocal both in public and in private of his distaste for Syndicalist and Socialist movements in Switzerland, and his opinion holds considerable sway."
swiss.146.a:0 "Hm."

swiss.150.t:0 "New Political Rivalries"
swiss.150.d:0 "With the old Federal government overthrown by proper Syndicalists and a new interim government created in its place, there is a clear struggle forming between the two main frontrunning parties for control.\n\nOne is Union Nationale under Georges Oltramare, adherents of the more radical Totalist charter. Their main opponents are the SPdS, the more mainstream Syndicalist party under Jules Humbert-Droz.\n\nWith the need to form a new government apparent, both sides have been rallying their supporters in a bid to be the first party come out on top."
swiss.150.a:0 "Why can't we get along?"
swiss.151.t:0 "Union Nationale March"
swiss.151.d:0 "The Union Nationale party, not wanting to wait for official discussions, got off to a head start today as party leaders organised a large march through the capital's streets. Thousands were in attendance and Union Nationale has shown that it has the support of many Swiss citizens."
swiss.151.a:0 "Oltramare takes the lead."
swiss.152.t:0 "Jules Humbert-Droz Speaks Against Totalism"
swiss.152.d:0 "Not content to allow the Union Nationale to simply walk away with the nation, today Jules Humbert-Droz broadcast a powerful radio address to the nation.\n\nIn his speech, he rallied against the extremist messages of Union Nationale, and warned that supporting such a party would betray the initial spirit of the revolution. Many have been swayed by the SPdS leader's message and Oltramare's support has fallen overnight."
swiss.152.a:0 "A fair point."
swiss.153.t:0 "Violence in Bern"
swiss.153.d:0 "In recent weeks, both the Totalist Union Nationale and the more traditionalist SPdS parties have been working hard to show themselves as the frontrunning party in the movement to assemble the new government.\n\nWith such a close race, tensions are bound to be high, and today a violent fight erupted in Bern between supporters of the two groups. Similar bouts of violence have been popping up around the nation, and the Union Council is beginning to worry that the violence will only escalate from here."
swiss.153.a:0 "Order is breaking down."
swiss.154.t:0 "The Union Council Calls for Formal Debate"
swiss.154.d:0 "In an effort to stop the violence spreading across the nation, the temporary Union Council has stepped into the fray in an attempt to resolve things peacefully. It has called upon both parties to agree to a series of formal debates, to be broadcast nationally over radio, in which both parties will attempt to state their case to the general populace.\n\nTo everyone's relief, the leaders of both parties have agreed and the debates are set to begin shortly."
swiss.154.a:0 "Let's settle this peacefully."
swiss.155.t:0 "The Debate Begins"
swiss.155.d:0 "Tonight marked the first round of the formal debates being held between the Union Nationale led by Geroges Oltramare and the SPdS led by Jules Humbert-Droz. Many topics were covered ranging from economic agenda to political reforms. While there are more debates to come, whoever is more successful in this first debate is likely to carry public support through subsequent debates.\n\nBoth potential leaders have good points but there can only be one winner."
swiss.155.a:0 "Georges Oltramare is victorious!"
swiss.155.b:0 "Jules Humbert-Droz has won!"
swiss.156.t:0 "Union Nationale Wins Public Support"
swiss.156.d:0 "Georges Oltramare's impassioned speech in the formal debate, combined with his multitude of rallies and marches, have shown the people of Switzerland that Union Nationale is the only party with enough support to form the new Syndicalist government. The Totalist movement has taken hold of the nation."
swiss.156.a:0 "Oltramare will form the new government."
swiss.157.t:0 "SPdS Wins Public Support"
swiss.157.d:0 "With Jules Humbert-Droz's sterling performance in the governmental debate, and the passion of his speeches against Totalism and Georges Oltramare, the hearts of the people have moved behind the SPdS. Union Nationale remains popular, but it is obvious that it no longer has enough public support to take the lead in the new government."
swiss.157.a:0 "Jules Humbert-Droz will form the new government."

swiss.159.t:0 "Foundation of the Swiss Merchant Marine"
swiss.159.d:0 "As Switzerland is a landlocked nation, it relies on trade with other nations to survive. To this end, the Swiss government has commissioned the purchase of several merchant vessels to operate under the Swiss flag.\n\nThese merchant vessels will participate in vital trade missions which will secure the necessary goods Switzerland needs to survive should her borders become compromised by conflict."
swiss.159.a:0 "Interesting."
swiss.160.t:0 "Christening of the EKS Helvetia"
swiss.160.d:0 "There was much celebration and excitement today as the government announced the official chirstening of the Swiss Navy's first flagship, the EKS Helvetia. This ship, a Light Cruiser produced from Switzerland's very own dockyards, is the first official flagship of the fleet and a symbol of Switzerland's overseas ambitions."
swiss.160.a:0 "The Swiss were born to sail."

swiss.161.t:0 "Returning Haute-Savoie"
swiss.161.d:0 "Now that our people have seen the light of a proper Syndicalist government and we no longer have a hostile relationship with our French brethren, it is about time we return to them the land of Haute-Savoie that we have been occupying these past years.\n\nThe Commune of France is the proper and legitimate government of France and we must honour our legal obligation ot return the land to them."
swiss.161.a:0 "We will honour our obligation."

swiss.162.d:0 "With Switzerland firmly in our sphere of influence, they have informed us of their intent to return the rightful French territory of Haute-Savoie to us. Naturally, we have accepted their offer and the territory is to be turned over to our administration posthaste."
swiss.162.a:0 "Wonderful."
swiss.163.t:0 "Syndicalist Parties Banned"
swiss.163.d:0 "With the new provisional military government in control of the nation, a proclamation has come from Bern that all Syndicalist organisations operating in the country, legally or otherwise, are to be immediately dissolved. This proclamation has been met with a surprising amount of popular support, as the remaining population of the country rallies against Syndicalist "traitors"."
swiss.163.a:0 "We're better off without them."
swiss.164.t:0 "Full Membership in Mitteleuropa"
swiss.164.d:0 "An agreement has been made to allow for economic supplies to flow from Mitteleuropa into Switzerland to keep the nation afloat. However, while this temporary arrangement is supporting our economy for now, perhaps we should consider full membership in Germany's economic bloc?"
swiss.164.a:0 "Let's join."
swiss.164.b:0 "Rather not."

swiss.165.t:0 "Farmers Hit by Black Monday"
swiss.165.d:0 "With the German economy in freefall, the prices of many agricultural goods have fallen with it. Swiss farmers, heavily reliant on trade with Germany, have been hit hard almost overnight, and many have taken to the streets to protest the government's inaction over the issue. The BGB (Party of Farmers, Traders and Independents) who represents the interests of many Swiss farmers, and Social Conservative KKP (Catholic-Conservative Party) have begun wavering in their commitment to the current governing alliance of Conservative and Market Liberal parties."
swiss.165.a:0 "This isn't good."
swiss.166.t:0 "Socialists Propose Reconciliation With France"
swiss.166.d:0 "As a part of their ambitious Syndicalist-styled plan to recover the Swiss economy, Socialist leaders in the Romandie have proposed that the Swiss government save the economy through reconciliation with the Commune of France.\n\nEver since Switzerland began the occupation of Haute-Savoie, the French have embargoed Switzerland, and cut off a valuable trade route for the Swiss economy. These socialist leaders have called for the return of this land to France as a sign of goodwill on behalf of Switzerland towards France."
swiss.166.a:0 "Not a chance."
swiss.167.t:0 "An Illegal Referndum in Savoie"
swiss.167.d:0 "With the Federal Government in Bern so adamantly opposed to the Socialist plans for reform, a movement has gained popularity for an organised referendum on sovereignty in Haute-Savoie. The Socialists believe that if the Savoyards can be shown to wish reunification with the Commune of France, then the government will have to support their plans. Bern has caught wind of this illegal referndum taking place in the region soon, and has vowed that such a vote outside of the law will not be allowed to take place."
swiss.167.a:0 "Stop this at once!"
swiss.168.t:0 "Violence in Haute-Savoie"
swiss.168.d:0 "The day of the proposed referendum has come, and violence runs rampant in Haute-Savoie. Swiss military presence in the occupied zone, on high alert on orders from Bern, has clashed repeatedly with Socialist and Syndicalist protestors attempting to organise the vote in the area.\n\nDozens have been beaten and bloodied, and the region is in a state of disarray as military forces and Socialist agitators from Romandie clash in the streets. It is only a matter of time before France hears of this commotion..."
swiss.168.a:0 "This got out of hand."
swiss.169.t:0 "Syndicalists Claim Referendum Victory"
swiss.169.d:0 "Days after the violence in Savoie, the Syndicalist Party of Switzerland has declared that the results of the referendum are in and the region has voted to rejoin the Commune of France. In the chaos, it is impossible to verify the integrity of the vote, and the Socialists, who hold the ballots, have not offered to hand anything over to the federal government. Many in Bern doubt the validity of the Socialist claim, but it has increasingly seemed like a shouting match between two sides that won't back down..."
swiss.169.a:0 "These results are illegal and unverified!"
swiss.170.t:0 "Violence in Occupied Haute-Savoie"
swiss.170.d:0 "Reports have come to Paris bearing news of the violent oppression of Syndicalist freedom fighters in Haute-Savoie who were attempting to organise a referendum on the region's return to French governance. The Swiss government in Bern has sent a military force to suppress the vote, and violence has broken out over the legality of the referendum. We can't ignore this violence against our people!"
swiss.170.a:0 "Frenchmen bleed on French soil!"

swiss.171.t:0 "Romandie Secedes"
swiss.171.d:0 "With no nation willing to defend Switzerland, and our government's weakness exposed for all the world to see, the local governments in Romandie, reinstated by French demands, have quickly voted to secede from the Swiss Confederation and join the Commune of France. We are powerless to stop them."
swiss.171.a:0 "Traitors, all of them."
swiss.172.t:0 "The Romand Secession"
swiss.172.d:0 "After Switzerland pathetically accepted our demands for the return of Haute-Savoie, they were forced to reinstate publicly elected Socialist officials that they so viciously removed from their posts earlier in the year. These politicians, to our surprise, wasted no time in voting on secession from the Swiss Confederation in favour of joining the Commune of France as brothers in French Socialism.\n\nWe of course have accepted their legal and popular move, and have welcomed them into our fold."
swiss.172.a:0 "A welcome surprise"

swiss.173.t:0 "A New National Identity"
swiss.173.d:0 "With the transition of the Swiss State to a more orderly regime under the guidance of the military, many have proposed the creation of a new national flag to represent the new order. A few designs have surfaced as popular enough to represent the nation. Which one should we move forward with?"
swiss.173.a:0 "We must maintain our current flag."
swiss.173.b:0 "The coat of arms on white background."
swiss.173.c:0 "The nationalist full-cross design."
swiss.173.e:0 "A flag more suiting the military regime."
swiss.174.t:0 "A New National Identity"
swiss.174.d:0 "A new era has dawned for the Swiss people under the new Syndicalist regime, and with it comes the need for a new national symbol and flag. A few designs have surfaced as popular enough to represent the nation. Which one should we move forward with?"
swiss.174.a:0 "The Helvetic Design with Syndicalist elements."
swiss.174.b:0 "The simple Helvetic design."
swiss.174.c:0 "Continue with the interim flag."
swiss.174.e:0 "Flag of the Syndicalist Party of Switzerland."

swiss.175.t:0 "Switzerland Seeks an Alliance"
swiss.175.d:0 "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland with a missive explaining that the current government of Switzerland has found a need to formalize our current relationship and join our new military alliance. How should we respond?"
swiss.175.a:0 "They made a wise decision."
swiss.175.b:0 "They would only drag us down."
swiss.176.t:0 "We Stand with Austria"
swiss.176.d:0 "Our diplomat to Vienna has sent news that Austria has issued a formal invitation to their international alliance, and welcome us with open arms. We now have a proper protector against any further untoward aggression."
swiss.176.a:0 "Our future is bright."
swiss.177.t:0 "Austria has Ignored Us!"
swiss.177.d:0 "Despite our diplomat's best efforts, we have been unable to get an official response from Austria with regards to a formalization of our current impromptu alliance. It seems that the Austrians are keen on keeping us out of their alliance, whatever reason they may have."
swiss.177.a:0 "But why?"
swiss.178.t:0 "Chaos in Haute-Savoie!"
swiss.178.d:0 "With French support and a lax military presence in the region, French saboteurs have managed to stir unrest in Haute-Savoie, and the administration will be forced to spare extra resources to maintain the peace. We must maintain a stronger military presence if we are to keep the region stable."
swiss.178.a:0 "We were too lax!"
swiss.179.t:0 "The Commune Defeated"
swiss.179.d:0 "The Commune of France has found itself soundly defeated and removed from the landscape of Europe. With the largest threat to our nation now a thing of the past, we no longer have to worry about the looming threat of war."
swiss.179.a:0 "Peace reigns!"
swiss.180.t:0 "Returning Haute-Savoie"
swiss.180.d:0 "With a semblance of peace and order restored to Europe in the form of the defeat of the Commune of France and a restoration of a legitimate French government, it is time we honor our obligations made at the end of the Weltkrieg and return Haute-Savoie to French control. We have been its careful stewards for many years, but our commitment to our promise is resolute. The territory must be returned, and the French government will surely be grateful for the safeguarding of their land."
swiss.180.syndie:0 "The old Swiss order has been overthrown, and in its place a new and proper Syndicalist government has arisen. In order to solidify our relation with our neighboring Syndicalist Commune of France, we must make good on a promise made many years ago and return Haute-Savoie to the Communard's rule. With this act of cooperation, we can surely align ourselves with the power that is France."
swiss.180.a:0 "It must go to the [FRA.GetName]."
swiss.180.b:0 "It must go to the [NFA.GetName]."
swiss.180.c:0 "It must go to the [FRP.GetName]."
swiss.181.t:0 "The Return of Haute-Savoie"
swiss.181.d:0 "Switzerland has approached us with an offer to return the region of Haute-Savoie to our control after controlling the region for nearly two decades. They have deemed our nation the rightful owners of the land, and according to their previous obligation of stewardship, have properly returned the region to us."
swiss.181.a:0 "They have honored their obligations."
swiss.182.t:0 "The Return of Haute-Savoie"
swiss.182.d:0 "Switzerland has approached us with an offer to return the region of Haute-Savoie to our control after controlling the region for nearly two decades. They have deemed our nation the rightful owners of the land, and according to their previous obligation of stewardship, have properly returned the region to us."
swiss.182.a:0 "They have honored their obligations."
swiss.183.t:0 "The Return of Haute-Savoie"
swiss.183.d:0 "Switzerland has approached us with an offer to return the region of Haute-Savoie to our control after controlling the region for nearly two decades. They have deemed our nation the rightful owners of the land, and according to their previous obligation of stewardship, have properly returned the region to us."
swiss.183.a:0 "They have honoured their obligations."
swiss.184.t:0 "Officers Protest"
swiss.184.d:0 "Many Officers have resigned out of protest in response to our declaration of Martial Law in the nation. Perhaps driven by some remaining loyalties to Syndicalist elements operating within our borders, these officers will leave a hole in our ranks that can only be filled with time."
swiss.184.a:0 "This is not ideal."
swiss.185.t:0 "Our Swiss Assets Nationalized"
swiss.185.d:0 "We have been informed that the nationalist regime in Switzerland has nationalized all foreign-owned economic assets in their nation in an attempt to gain greater control over their economy. Naturally, we have not-insignificant holdings there, and we are under pressure to regain the lost capital for our citizens."
swiss.185.a:0 "We won't forget this."
swiss.186.t:0 "The New Order Falls"
swiss.186.d:0 "Not even a year after toppling the old Swiss government and establishing a military dictatorship "for the good of the nation", the government of the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband has shown itself completely incapable of rallying public support.\n\nAn increasing amount of public protests have culminated in a storming of governmental offices in the capital and the seizing of key areas by mutinous military units in league with the uprising.\n\nEugen Bircher is missing, as are many of the officers involved in the coup, but for now a new government has been created from more moderate conservatives in the government until the old Federal Government can be properly restored."
swiss.186.a:0 "Long live Switzerland."
swiss.187.t:0 "Outpost Raided"
swiss.187.d:0 "An outpost in Mittelland, not responding to radio contact, was today discovered to have been attacked and raided by an unknown enemy. It is theorized the attackers were Syndicalist sympathizers, looking to arm themselves with the weapons stored at the location. The men defending the outpost were found to have been killed defending it. We must avenge their deaths."
swiss.187.a:0 "Scoundrels."
swiss.188.t:0 "Gunfire in Bern."
swiss.188.d:0 "Gunfire rang out in the early morning today in Bern as unidentified gunmen attempted to attack a military patrol moving through the streets. The gunmen were killed without military casualties, but the shock of the incident has rattled citizen's trust in our control of internal affairs."
swiss.188.a:0 "Troubling."
swiss.189.t:0 "Popular Support Rising"
swiss.189.d:0 "Our recent policy of increased military patrols and police presence have reduced crime rates dramatically across the nation, and the people are slowly coming around to the idea of our government being their protectors."
swiss.189.a:0 "We protect the people."
swiss.190.t:0 "An increase in patrols?"
swiss.190.d:0 "While our recent military activities have been successful in quashing resistance across the nation, especially in urban areas, it has been proposed that we increase our military presence in the more rurual regions of Switzerland as well. These are the regions most difficult to maintain order in, and it would require a significant increase in manpower to cover these areas."
swiss.190.a:0 "It will be done."
swiss.190.b:0 "Those men are better spent elsewhere."
swiss.191.t:0 "Fighting on the Frontier"
swiss.191.d:0 "Our recent decision to oust foreign agents from the nation has driven many to the frontiers to hide and work against the state. In recent days these fighters have been in numerous battles against military forces patrolling in these areas, and casualties have mounted among our forces."
swiss.191.a:0 "Damn them."
swiss.192.t:0 "The Nation Secured"
swiss.192.d:0 "Despite the continual efforts of Syndicalist partisans to sabotage our efforts to maintain peace and order, we have successfully identified and crushed all major sources of resistance and potential dangers to the government. With this, a new era of peace can be ushered in."
swiss.192.a:0 "Peace at last."
swiss.193.t:0 "French-Swiss flow into France"
swiss.193.d:0 "The rising tide of anti-French sentiment has manifested itself in recent days in a string of violence and harassment against the significant French-speaking population remaining in the nation. This divide has caused a wave of citizens to flow over the border into the French-occupied Haute-Savoie, and the military is struggling to clamp down on some of the more extreme cases of discrimination in the countryside."
swiss.193.a:0 "Less traitors to worry about."
swiss.194.t:0 "French-Swiss flow into France"
swiss.194.d:0 "Unable to accept the truth of a unified France under a Syndicalist regime, the reactionary government of Switzerland has begun a new campaign of persecution against the population of French-speaking Swiss still within their borders. This has resulted in a flow of migrants over the border into our nation, and many have shown an interest in taking up arms for an eventual liberation of their homeland from the reactionary menace."
swiss.194.a:0 "You are welcomed with open arms."
swiss.195.t:0 "Death of Arthur Fonjallaz"
swiss.195.d:0 "Early this morning, the Minister of the Interior, Arthur Fonjallaz, was found dead. After preliminary examination, doctors have determined that he passed peacefully in his sleep. He was a truly great man who worked tirelessly for his country, and the party."
swiss.195.a:0 "Give my condolences to his family."
swiss.196.t:0 "Death of Giuseppe Motta"
swiss.196.d:0 "Early this morning, the statesman Giuseppe Motta, passed away. He spent his last few days in the company of his family and his doctors, however he could not be cured. He was a truly great man who worked tirelessly in service and advocacy for his country, and will be remembered by many."
swiss.196.a:0 "He will be missed."

SWI_peace_mission_ongoing_desc:0 "With a sudden increase in French activists rallying against our mandated occupation of Haute-Savoie, the Commune of France is no doubt involved, and seeking to inflame anti-Swiss sentiment in the region.

SWI_Savoie_decisions:0 "The Fate of Haute-Savoie"
SWI_Savoie_decisions_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the French Republic, Switzerland has maintained a military occupation of Haute-Savoie to fulfill their mandate of maintaining neutrality in the region.
