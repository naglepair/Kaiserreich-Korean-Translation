qing.104.t:0 "The Legation Cities"
qing.104.d:0 "The Legation Cities were the richest coastal cities of China and now they are under foreign control. With the southern provinces in our hands we should try to regain these lost territories as well. There is however a problem since the Treaty ports, as they're called, contain significant foreign investments and capital, and it may be unwise to antagonise all the major world powers."

qing.115.t:0 "Qing deal"
qing.115.d:0 "The Qing ambassador approached us and gave us an ultimatum about joining the Qing Empire. He offered to bring us to the table with Emperor Pu Yi. We don't have much choice but maybe we can stay independent."

qing.118.t:0 "Tibetan ignorance"
qing.118.d:0 "Tibet ignored our rightful demands about reuniting our Empire. Military response is the only answer to this insult."
qing.118.a:0 "Emperor Pu-Yi won't stand this insult!"
qing.118.b:0 "Then just let them be and look for a new target"
qing.119.t:0 "Dealing with Mongolia"
qing.119.d:0 "After seizing control of our western provinces, only territory of Mongolia is not under our control.

qing.132.a:0 "We must liberate our homeland!"
qing.132.b:0 "This is too dangerous."
qing.133.t:0 "Negotiations with Fengtian?"
qing.133.d:0 "The decision that Fengtian Republic will be our next target is really risky. Fengtian republic boasts itself with most powerful armed forces of all warlord states and any military encounter with it would be detrimental to our cause of united China. We should perhaps try to bring Fengtian back to our empire diplomatically?"
qing.133.a:0 "It's worth a try"
qing.133.b:0 "Impossible is impossible"
qing.134.t:0 "Negotiations with Qing?"
qing.134.d:0 "The Qing ambassador approached us and gave us an ultimatum about joining the Qing Empire, unless our state wants to face unspecified military and diplomatic response. Despite strength of our armed forces it might be for the best to negotiate with Qing Empire."
