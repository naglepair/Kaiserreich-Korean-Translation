POLITICS_GEORGE_VAN_HORN_MOSELEY:0 "필리핀의 기병 중위에서부터 워싱턴의 장성에 이르기까지 모즐리는 미 육군에서의 40년간의 복무동안 화려한 경력을 자랑합니다. 조지 패튼과 맥아더와 같은 장군들과 함께 복무한 경험은 휴이 롱을 지지하기로 한 그의 마지막 결정과 유대인 음모에 대한 그의 확고한 믿음에 영향을 주었습니다. 결국 모든 형태의 사회주의의 위험에 대한 그의 믿음은 그를 비상대권위원회의 완벽한 대변인으로 만들었습니다. 모즐리가 없었다면 세간에서 말하듯이 그가 연루되었다는 휴이 롱 실종사건에서 비상대권위원회가 휴이 롱을 계승하는 것은 불가능했을 것입니다."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_DUDLEY_PELLEY:0 "39세의 윌리엄 펠리는 다소 상상력이 모자란 할리우드의 시나리오 작가이자 저널리스트였습니다. 그는 과거에 모험을 즐겼는데 그 대부분은 러시아를 방문하고 반유대주의 팸플릿의 내용을 흡수하는 것으로 이루어집니다. 1933년 그가 은색 군단을 설립했을 때, 펠리는 앵글로-색슨계 백인 우월주의 옹호자이자 호전적인 무당으로 변했습니다. 펠리의 신내림은 그 주변에 믿을 수 있는 동맹들만 남겨지게 했습니다. 그의 조직이 휴이 롱에게 지원받은 이후, 펠리는 같은 부류인 앵글로-색슨 우월주의자인 허버트 W 암스트롱을 만나 펠리-암스트롱 연대를 공식화했습니다. 묵인, 반사회주의, 그리고 기독교 정체성에 대한 믿음은 그의 정권의 근간을 이룹니다."
POLITICS_GERALD_L_K_SMITH:0 "지도자 이상의 추종자로 여겨지는 수십 년 동안, 제럴드 스미스는 기독교 순례을 하던 1937년에 은색 군단에 입단한 후 독립했습니다. 사회 초년에 장관직을 임명받은 스미스는 처음에는 휴이 롱의 부 공유 협회의 영향을 받았습니다. 스미스는 펠리가 휴이 롱을 전복시켰을 때에는 배척을 받기도 했습니다. 스미스는 펠리 밑에서 수 년 동안 그가 싸지른 똥을 치우는 심복으로 일했습니다. 스미스의 인생에 있어서의 중요한 전환점은 금주법의 붕괴 이후에 부 공유 협회가 그를 휴이 롱의 대체자로 임명했을 때였습니다. 이후 스미스는 최고존엄 펠리가 대중에 대해 싸지르는 분노를 막는 조련사가 되었습니다.
POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_LONG:0 "1932년에 얼 롱은 형인 휴이 롱에 의해 부주지사의 자리를 거부당한 적이 있습니다. 그 후로 얼 롱은 형의 그림자 밑에서 오랫동안 살아왔습니다. 얼은 의회에서 진보적인 정책에 대한 지지뿐만 아니라 주 정부에 대한 제일당의 권한 행사도 지지하는 것으로 잘 알려져 있습니다. 휴이 롱이 죽기 오래 전부터 미리 결정한 후계자인 얼은 형과 같은 개혁주의 의제를 제시하고 있지만, 형보다는 보수적이고 보다 관대한 인품를 보이기도 합니다. 이제 얼 롱은 휴이 롱의 교육 및 복지 개혁을 실행에 옮겨야 할 의무를 안게 되었습니다. 그리고 얼의 인종차별적인 발언과 정신불안증세는 제일당에 의해 잘 은폐되고 있습니다."
POLITICS_CHARLES_LINDBERGH:0 "애칭인 린디로 불리는 찰스 린드버그는 한때 미국에서 가장 유명한 조종사였습니다. 미국 항공 우편 서비스의 시작과 함께 린드버그의 명성은 1920년대까지 크게 성장했습니다. 이것은 결국 사업용 비행기들을 개선하기 위한 요령들과 함께 린드버그를 더욱 유명하게 만들었습니다. 린드버그와 제일당 간의 관계는 1932년부터 시작해서 그가 비상대권위원회에 접촉할 때까지 돈독해졌습니다. 마침내 비대위에서 차기 지도자로 뽑힌 린드버그는 모즐리의 인종차별주의적 입장을 지속시키고 산업과 같은 여러 분야에서의 혁신을 장려할 계획입니다."

## Argentina ##
POLITICS_CARLES_DESC:0 "Manuel Carles began his political career when joined the Union Civica Radical 1898, which had been gaining popularity as it had recently been formed, back in 1891. He then climbed through the ranks of the party until he managed to become a national deputy for the province of Santa Fe in the national congress. He was assigned in 1918 by his colleague, president Hipólito Yrigoyen, as 'Interventor' of the Salta province, starting a long record of interventions by said government. His methods granted him enough experience to be allowed to become a teacher in the 'Colegio Militar de la Nacion' and the 'Escuela Superior de Guerra'.\n\nWith the unoficial formation of the 'Liga Patriotica' during the 'Semana Tragica', Carles began making contact with the organisation, which was officially born in 1920 with Carlés as its leader. The organisation then began promoting the persecution of jews, anarchists, socialists and foreigners that refuse to integrate to the local Argentinean culture, and with the growing unrest, he began scheming his takeover, backed by many within the navy and a few army officers. With his coup d'etat now being succesful, he now sits in the 'Casa Rosada' in Buenos Aires, but his regime has not yet been recognized by the other provinces. Whether he'll be able to secure power and accomplish his promises of expansion and prosperity remains to be seen..."
POLITICS_DOMINGO_PERON_DESC:0 "Juan Domingo Perón, having grown up in the rural Patagonia, entered the 'Colegio Militar de la Nación' In 1911 thanks to a scholarship paid by Antonio M. Silva, a close friend of his grandfather. Despite becoming a national fencing champion, which turned him into a celebrity for the oligarchy, he's hardly had any relevant political position in his life, but the FOP's secession from Argentina has caused him great concern. After a short trip to Europe, he has changed his point of view regarding politics, and has returned to Argentina motivated by a will to help the working men of the country and take the nation to new heights. Now, with many in the lower classes, the trade unions and even in the Oligarchy desiring Peron's leadership, it remains to be seen if he will truly be able to achieve his promises..."
POLITICS_ALICIA_JUSTO_DESC:0 "Alicia Moreau de Justo was born in 1885 in the city of London, England. Her father, Armand Mureau, was a member of the French Paris Commune during the 1871 uprising and Her family was forced to move to Argentina in 1890. She met Hipólito Yrigoyen, who was professor of moral and civic instruction in her school, where they kept a friendly relation, with Yrigoyen beggining to inspire the young woman towards political activism. In 1906 she founded the Argentinean Feminist Movement, joining the Socialist Party and later entering the 'Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Buenos Aires' in 1907, where she graduated as a Physician a few years later.\n\nHowever, with the Great War raging on and the anarchist uprisings, her views began to conflict with the more radicalized Baldomeristas in the PS. As the Red Scare ran through the nation, she was forced to go underground until very recently. Always valuing democracy and pacifism, now Mureau has managed to become Head of State, where she is bound to try to take the country towards her vision of a new, equal and peaceful Argentina."
POLITICS_PABLO_RAMIREZ_DESC:0 "Pedro Pablo Ramirez went to military school at a young age, even managing to serve in the German Army until 1913. He was one of the most active members of the 1930 Uriburu's coup d’état, and was his head of the information service of the general staff until Uriburu's death in 1932. While not a direct member of the GOU, his son is one of the founders, granting him a wide array of military and political contacts that he can use if the situation requires it.\n\nNow that Ramirez has managed to become Head of State, he shall rule Argentina with an iron-fist, trying to enforce the discipline, nationalism and faith in Catholicism he was taught to the Argentinean society at large. However, it remains to be seen if his connections within the GOU are enough to stay in power if he ever manages to deviate from their vision for Argentina..."
POLITICS_JOSE_TAMBORINI_DESC:0 "Jose Pascual Tamborini joined the 'Union Civica Radical' when he was still in highschool. He was one of the mediators between the workers at the 'Taller Vassena' and the national authorities, where he failed to successfully reach a compromise, which lead to a major crackdown in the events leading up to the dreaded 'Semana Tragica'. His party didn't fare much better, as the increasing authoritarianism of Yrigoyen began splitting the party into the old 'UCR' and the new 'Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista'.\n\nTamborini joined the latter while he was minister of the interior during Marcelo T. de Alvear's presidency. In 1935 he was chosen as national deputy, and his political experience has managed to allow him to get enough support to run for presidency. Now that he's head of state, it falls to him to bring about the reforms that Leandro N. Alem, founder of the 'UCR' back in 1891, had envisioned for Argentina, and end once and for all the corrupt practices that have plagued Argentinean democracy!"
POLITICS_ROBUSTIANO_COSTAS_DESC:0 "Robustiano Patrón Costas graduated from highschool in 1895 and by 1900, he had graduated the 'Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales de Buenos Aires' as a Lawyer with a PhD in jurisprudence, accomplishing one of his father's last wishes before he died. Robustiano took over his father's company, 'Patrón Hermanos' and then went on to become involved in Salta's Politics until he was elected governor of the same province between 1913 and 1916 with an independent party. His government in that province was characterized by great political stability and financial balance, and became one of the first provinces to fully embrace the Saenz Peña law.\n\nIn 1932, with the death of Uriburu and the upcoming elections, he formed among other independent leaders the 'Partido Democratico Nacional', where he was chosen as head of the party. Now that Robustiano has managed to achieve presidency, his entrepreneurial spirit, fiscal responsibility and compromise skills will surely usher in a new age of economic prosperity for Argentina."
POLITICS_NICOLAS_REPETTO_DESC:0 "Nicolas Repetto graduated as physician from the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' with plenty of experience in surgery thanks to an European internship which lasted until 1897. He was very active in politics from a young age, participating in the 'Revolucion del Parque' in 1890. Afterwards, he founded with his friend, Juan B. Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to affiliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\nAfter the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, but didn't manage to win the 1932 national elections. Now that he has managed to become president, he'll strive to turn Argentina away from the exploitative practices of the past and into a better, more egalitarian tomorrow."
POLITICS_HIPOLITO_YRIGOYEN_DESC:0 "When Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Yrigoyen finished high school, he began his political career when he assisted Alem in the creation of the Union Civica, and when it subsequently split during the Roca regime, he continued assisting his uncle with the Union Civica Radical. He kept climbing through the ranks of the party until becoming his uncle right-hand man and participating in the 'Revolución del Parque' as one of the main instigators. However, Alem's suicide became a hard hit for the UCR, and an even harder hit for Yrigoyen, who temporarily retired from politics until 1904, working as a teacher in the meantime.\n\nHe then reorganized the UCR in 1904 and managed to get one of his friends, Roque Sáenz Peña, elected as President in 1910, and even becoming President himself from 1916 to 1922. He pushed for progressive reforms and tried to normalize the Argentinean electoral system, even intervening in provinces that were under the control of wealthy elites. He even began granting workers better work laws and began negotiating with many strikers. However, British pressure forced him to begin the crackdowns that lead to the 'Semana Tragica', and the events that subsequently created the FOP.\n\nHis increasing authoritarianism lead to factionalism in the UCR and the subsequent split of the UCRA, and when he was re-elected in 1938, where his antagonizing position against the army and the local elites caused the Uriburu's 1930 coup, where he was banned from politics. Now that he's president again, he'll finish the reforms that he started in 1928 and will try to bring about his uncle's vision of a strong and democratic Argentina."
POLITICS_JOSE_PETER_DESC:0 "Jose Peter, like many other 'Gauchos' from rural areas, was forced to move to the big cities in search of work, more specifically to the city of Zarate in 1923. His first political experience was in 1927, when he signed up with the 'Sindicato de Frigorificos de Zarate', where he helped create the 'Federación Obreros de la Industria de la Carne' with other trade unions of Zarate and Berisso.\n\nWhen Uriburu came to power, he was sent to the Ushuaia penitentiary after organizing a successful strike where he demanded the company 'River Plate de Zarate' to pay their worker's wages which had been delayed for two months. Now that he's free and in control of Argentina, he'll make sure to provide justice for the workers from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie."
POLITICS_ANGEL_BORLENGHI_DESC:0 "Angel Borlenghi became involved in politics with the local socialists of Pompeya's neighbourhood at a very young age, joining the 'Gremio de Empleados de Comercio'('Trade Employees Syndicate') and the Socialist Party as soon as he came of age. Unlike the leadership within the Socialist Party, he liked to keep direct contact with the workers, which gained him a lot of support among the trade unions. Despite having an illustrious performance within the 'CGT' ('Central General del Trabajo'), he never managed to climb up the ranks within the Socialist Party.\n\nAfter Uriburu's coup and the subsequent crackdowns on anarchist, syndicalists and socialists, he was arrested and taken to the Ushuaia penitentiary. Now that he's free and sits within the 'Casa Rosada', He'll use his connections within the Trade Unions to lead Argentina to a better tomorrow with the worker's consent."
POLITICS_ARTURO_FRONDIZI_DESC:0 "Arturo Frondizi was a strong supporter of the UCR and a defender of democracy when Yrigoyen managed to win the presidency, but refused to participate in any sort of political activity. However, Uriburu's coup forced him to change his point of view regarding democracy, where he even refused attending his own graduation ceremony which Uriburu would attend to give him an Honor Diploma in Law.\n\nHe was arrested in a democratic demonstration in 1931. This very detention has made Frondizi decide to leave his work as a law professor and begin a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested at another rally, and when he was released he joined the UCR.\n\nHe has since then joined a faction within the UCR that considers the approach of Marcelo T. de Alvear to be too conservative, and he has made promises to bring more progressive reforms to Argentina and return to the economic policies Yrigoyen enacted. Now that he sits in the 'Casa Rosada', it remains to be seen if he'll be true to his word."
POLITICS_RICARDO_BALBIN_DESC:0 "In 1922, when he became 18, Ricardo Balbín joined the UCR and moves to La Plata, where local political activism drove him to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, but hardly ever using his title as he has since then fully committed to his political career.\n\nHe was chosen as provincial deputy in 1932 and 1940, however, he resigned his last post in condemnation to the fraud that plagued local elections. He has since then left the UCR and joined the more moderate 'Partido Democrata Nacional', where he has promised to bring an end to the corruption that plagues Argentinean society and finally usher in a new era of prosperity."
POLITICS_ROBERTO_ORTIZ_DESC:0 "Roberto Marcelino Ortiz signed up into the 'Universidad de Buenos Aires' to study medicine, but he was forced to change his career to Law due to a strike from the students’ center which caused the medicine section to be closed down temporarily. He affiliated the UCR and participated in the failed 1905 revolution. When the UCR split, he joined the UCRA and became public works minister for Marcelo T. de Alvear.\n\nDespite his support for the democratic process, he supported Uriburu's coup, although he despised Uriburu's economic policies. After the Carlés coup, Ortiz has become convinced that the political corruption in Argentina has to end once and for all if democracy is ever to survive in Argentina, and will endeavour all of his efforts from the 'Casa Rosada' to strengthen the democratic process and end local corruption, with intervention if needed."
POLITICS_EDELMIRO_FARRELL_DESC:0 "Born to an Irish migrant family, Edelmiro Julian Farrel enrolled in a military school and graduated in 1907. While no one doubts of his military ability and personal charisma, he was never prepared to be a politician. Now that the role of presidency has been thrusted upon him after overthrowing Ramirez, he has become a mere puppet of the GOU's control over the country. He relies mostly on his vice-president, Juan Domingo Peron, to do most of the political work, where Farrel only ever appears in public ceremonies and signs public documents in the name of the GOU."
POLITICS_MARCELO_ALVEAR_DESC:0 "알베아르는 어린 나이에 정치에 관여하게 되었고, 플로리다 가든에서 회의를 조직하는 것을 도왔는데, 이것은 '혁명의 공원'으로 이어졌으며, 그 후 그는 레안드로 N. 알렘의 비서가 되었습니다. 그는 알렘이 자살할 때까지 계속 그를 섬겼고, 그 후 그는 프랑스로 잠시 떠나 결혼했습니다. 그는 1912년과 1916년 사이에 국내에 거주하지도 않은 채 의원으로 선출되었으며, 그는 사엔즈 페냐 정권 동안 아르헨티나로 돌아오도록 강요받았고, 그 후 프랑스 주재 아르헨티나 대사가 되었으며, 최전방 병원 건립을 위해 많은 재산을 기부하기도 했습니다. 대전쟁에서 패배했음에도 불구하고, 알베아르는 자신의 친 협상국 관점을 고수하였고, 이로 인해 아르헨티나가 세계 정세에 중립을 유지해야 한다고 믿는 전 급진시민연합 대통령인 이리고옌과 충돌하게 되었습니다.\n\n 그는 1922년부터 1928년까지 대통령으로 선출되었고, 그는 라디오로 녹음된 최초의 아르헨티나 대통령이 되었습니다. 그는 주로 군국주의적 영향 때문에 FOP에 강경한 자세를 취했음에도 불구하고 국내 근로자들에게 더 나은 권리를 부여함으로써 FOP의 영향력을 줄이려고 노력했습니다. 그의 전임자인 이리고옌처럼, 그는 부유한 지역 엘리트들에 의해 선거 조작을 한 지방들에 개입하려고 노력했지만, 그의 방법은 급진시민연합과 반개인주의적 급진시민연합을 훨씬 더 양극화시켰습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 그의 진보적인 사회, 교육, 경제 개혁은 아르헨티나 국민들에게 긍정적인 인상을 남겼고, 이제 그가 대통령으로 다시 선출되었기 때문에, 그는 그의 첫 번째 대통령직에서 그가 지지했던 개혁을 재연하려고 노력할 것입니다."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_DE_ANDREA_DESC:0 "Miguel de Andrea began his career after being ordained in 1899 by the Bishop of La Plata, Juan Terrero. He climbed steadily the ranks of the church until becoming the Head Priest of the San Miguel de Arcangel Church, and being named director of a Social-Christian Trade Union, the Circulos Obreros Catolicos, after the death of its founder, Federico Grote. However, unlike his founder, Miguel de Andrea took a hardline stance against the rising anarchist movements growing in the city of Buenos Aires, and as such quickly found himself alligning with the Liga Patriotica, taking part in their rallies and putting them into contact with the most reactionary sectors of the Argentinean branch of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, his views never alligned with the league, and he found himself coinciding more with the Portuguese Integralists who catered to his anti-liberal, ultra-catholic and Corporatist mindset. While originally skeptic of a Brazilian victory, he quickly abandoned the Liga Patriotica as the defeat seemed imminent, and began pushing his contacts in the Brazilian church in order to proclaim his loyalty to the Integralists. Without any solid military or civilian leaders willing to obey Brazilian commands, Miguel was chosen as the provisional President of Argentina until a more stable government can be settled in favour of the Integralist doctrine, which Miguel believes will finally bring faith in God, the Church and the government back to the workers."

POLITICS_LALA_LAJPAT_RAI_DESC:0 "미국에서 독립운동을 하던 펀자비 힌두교 자선가인 라라 라지팟 라이가 인도에서의 새로운 사회주의 국가가 건국되었음을 공식적으로 천명하기 위해 돌아왔습니다. 1925년 말 영국 통치 체제가 붕괴되면서 라이는 인도의 다른 사회주의 인사들과 함께 벵갈 인민 공화국의 건국을 선언했습니다. 이 인민 공화국은 처음에는 무력으로 인도를 통합하는데 실패했지만, 대륙 북동부 3분의 1을 성공적으로 확보했습니다. 한때 인민 공화국 지도부의 비교적 온건파였던 라이는 통일에 대한 야망을 표현하고자 바라티야 코뮌으로 국명을 바꾸었고, 지금은 경쟁 사회주의 파벌들의 거센 반대에 직면해 있습니다. 고령인 데다가 영향력이 약해진 라이는 사임 의사를 밝혔습니다. 그의 후임자는 코뮌 자체의 미래를 결정게 될 것입니다."
POLITICS_FAZLUL_HUQ_DESC:0 "현재 인정받은 생디칼리스트이자 벵골 무슬림 연맹의 전임 총무였던 파줄룰 후크는 자신의 '온건주의자' 파벌을 인도 국민회의 특별회의에서 승리로 이끌었습니다. 그는 노조 중심의 산업화와 사회주의 개혁의 점진적인 시행을 위해 캠페인을 벌였습니다. 그러나 선거에서의 성공에도 불구하고, 후크는 여전히 인도 국민회의의 반대파들의 강한 반대에 직면해 있다. 그럼에도 불구하고 역사적으로 빈곤한 동부 인도의 번영과 아마도 언젠가 전체 아대륙으로 확대될 번영에 대한 비전은 적어도 후크의 지지자들에게는 점점 더 성취 가능한 목표로 여겨집니다."
POLITICS_CHANDRA_BOSE_DESC:0 "학창 시절에 수바스 찬드라 보세는 한때 사랑하는 인도를 모욕했다며 영국인 교장을 때린 적이 있습니다. 그 후 퇴학당한 보세는 거의 광적인 복수심에 불타 올랐습니다. 영국령 인도가 붕괴되기 직전에 보세는 인도의 독립을 반대하는 사람들에 대항하는 선동적인 연설로 많은 인도인들을 사회주의의 명분으로 끌어들였습니다. 보세와 최대주의자들의 인도국민국회에서의 성공과 함께 바라티야 코뮌은 전반적으로 군국주의와 비슷한 견해를 갖기 시작했으며, 이제는 자치령과 토후 연맹의 심장부에 결정적인 한 방을 날릴 것으로 보여집니다."
POLITICS_MOHANDAS_GHANDI_DESC:0 "전직 변호사 모한다스 카람찬드 간디는 영국의 지배로부터 인도의 점진적이고 평화적이며 합법적인 독립을 주장하여 높은 평가를 받았습니다. 그러나 영국령 인도의 붕괴와 함께, 그와 그의 많은 추종자들은 자신들의 입장을 재고할 수 밖에 없었습니다. 여전히 평화주의자이면서도 간디는 현재 급진화된 인도 국민회의에서 동료들의 사상의 영향을 점점 더 받고 있습니다. 간디의 인도 국민회의 특별회의에서의 승리는 인도 아대륙의 평화적 통일과 분열된 파벌의 화해를 위한 새로운 희망을 일깨워주었습니다."
POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC:0 "Jawaharlal Nehru is almost certainly the most tactful of the Bharatiya Commune's prominent political leaders. With the collapse of the British Raj, Nehru, while a staunch advocate for immediate independence from the weakened Empire, worked tireless to mediate all manner of disputes among Indian leaders across the political spectrum. While his detractors would slander Nehru as indecisive and cowardly, Nehru's subtle political manoeuvring was essential for his ascension to the highest levels of the Indian National Congress, and now the Bharatiya Commune itself. Under Nehru's leadership, perhaps the factionalism which has plagued the Congress for decades may finally be assuaged."
POLITICS_NIRMAL_KUMAR_BOSE_DESC:0 "Nirmal Kumar Bose, protégé of the famous Mohandas Gandhi, has assumed leadership of the Bharatiya Commune. He is likely to continue the agrarian reforms of Ghandi, and encourage the non-violent reunification of India.

POLITICS_OTAVIO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "Otavio made his politcal debut in 1908 at the contentious politics of the state of Bahia, and his rapid rise in notoriety gave him fame, and some exiles from the state as well. Said notoriety was enough for him to later become a State Representative in 1912. His staunch positions in favour of the late Washington Luis and João Pessoa during the times of civil helped to raise his profile to greater heights, and he was elected president of the State of Bahia in the elections organized there in 1928. Later, as consensus bid for the Brazilian Republican Party, his name was put foward for the position of President of the Republic, and was endorsed by then President João Pessoa. His presidency was very much a return to normalcy at first, but the rise of radical movements especially in the cities, and public order in general, is a rising concern. However, the good pace of economic and political recovery has ensured his popularity remains high, and it is possible that some of this popularity is why João Mangabeira, his brother, became a household name more left wing circles."

Ever since he has dedicated himself to helping push the movement's agenda, writing several well selling books on the subject, but also his own anti-semitic views, especially in the first translated copy of the Protocols of the Heirs of Zion in Brazilian Portguese, and also dedicates himself to poetry and studies of Brazilian folklore, which garnered him a seat at the Brazilian Academy of Letters. His profound nationalism and hatred of precieved foreign meddling made him gain especial disdain and hatred for Syndicalists in Brazil, whom he claims are French spies sent to establish a puppet republic."
POLITICS_GETULIO_VARGAS_BRA_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the border state of Rio Grande do Sul, Getúlio Vargas always had a knack for politics. Since his earliest forays into state politics, he always was a skilled navigator and, according to some, a shrewd manipulator. While he only entered politics in 1913, by the time of the Revolution of 27 he was already State President of his home province, and his diplomatic skill managed to both prevent intervention from foreigners and to ensure that Rio Grande do Sul sided against the Federal forces. After the war, Vargas became Vice President under João Pessoa, and became far more well known nation wide, taking time to appear in radio and other public adresses as a man ''looking out for the little guy'' while he could do so. Since Otávio Mangabeira took office, he spent four years articulating an energic presidential campaign. Always professing non extreme, but powerful views on the future of Brazil, Vargas believes that the only way the nation can truly enter the modern era is through and extensive campaign of industralisation, modernisation and rearmament, a process that he believes no person or law has any right to impede, for his intention is to always act with Brazil's best intentions first and foremost."

Respected for his efforts during the Civil War and beyond, the officer has enough gravitas to pull together a haphardly government, which is more or less a dictatorship all but in name, to keep order in this time of extreme crisis.

A friend and supporter of Washington Luís, Prestes was devasted by his sudden assatination and rallied behind the cause during the coming crisis and conflict, but was glad that it ended as quickly as it did. He gained renewed political vigour afterwards, and claims to be trying his best to uphold the legacy of his friend Washington. Following the defeat of Bahia's liberals in the previous elections, Julio found himself as an almost unanimous choice for candiate of the Liberal Party, and his victory again renewed his vigour to uphold the liberal and positvist principles he defended throughout his life, as the Liberals finally have a chance to make Brazil a truly free country."

POLITICS_ABILIO_NEQUETE_DESC:0 "An orthodox christian hailing from Lebanon, Abilio de Nequete is actually not his birth name, that being Abdo Nakt. He came to Brazil looking for his father, who had emigrated years earlier than him, in 1903, and reuinted with him shortly thereafter. However, soon their political differences put a wedge on their relationships, and later on  Abilio converted to Spiritism and joined union circles. Inspired by the revolutions in Europe, he joined the anarchist International Workers Union, but their militant atheism caused him and some other men to split off and form the Maximalist Union, a party that opposed their ideas in more matters than just religion. The Maximalist movement grew and garned much strength in Porto Alegre, but still he faced opposition from anarchist unions, who were still the majority in the city, but his influence grew with time. In recent years, he was influenced by other centralist socialists abroad, and his Maximalist Union was one of the many leftist movements to support the so called Democratic Left. He is well respected by most Syndicalists in Brazil, even if his scathing and combative personality got him kicked out of more than one meeting. To him, Brazil's many issues after a decade of chaos can only be solved by a firm hand and unity among the people, a view shared by many army and navy officers.

By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defence of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key turning point in the electoral race, and he became nationally known after the endorsement, Thrusted into his new position by the first congress of trade unions, Mangabeira is the first black president and the first syndicalist to occupy the highest office in the country, and the nation holds its breath to see what will come to pass during the Oliveira government."
POLITICS_MACIEL_BRA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Olegário his political career all the way back in 1880, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot on the grave'' is dangerous for Brazilian democracy, the three time state president of Minas Gerais' politcal power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. His long support of Vargas in the Republican Party can be seen as ideological similarities, as both see a united and proactive federal government as vital for a better Brazil, but their alliance is often seen as one of convenience between the most powerful politicians of two powerful states of the Union. While his platform during elections was mostly a repeat of Vargas's 10 years ago, the ''old man president'' doesnt really considers the southerner his sucessor, as he envisions Gustavo Capanema as the one to inherit his political legacy in Brazil as a whole."
POLITICS_BORGES_DE_MEDEIROS_BRA_DESC:0 "Few men alive had as much of an impact in Brazilian politics, and especially in the Rio Grande do Sul state, as Antônio Augusto Borges de Medeiros, known politically by his last two names. Starting his political career in the 1890s, he swiftly rose through the ranks and assumed the position of state president from 1898 to 1908 and from 1913 to 1926, and was at the centre of the innumerable political crises, revolts and intrigues in Rio Grande do Sul during the timeframe, while also steadily rising to national proimience. Considered by many a man of unparalleled charisma and integrity, Borges refused a judicial position early in his life, in 1892, to focus entirely on politics, and has always tried to strike a balance between his ideas for a progressive Brazil and the whirlwind of political forces in his country and state. Having positioned himself very publically in favour of São Paulo in 1927, his views on the integrity of the state's soverignty remain unchanged, as does his disdain for any centralizing overtures by the goverment in Rio de Janeiro. Now elected president at nearly his eighties, his positivist beliefs are staunchier than ever, after the national-level schsim of the liberal party and a contested electoral race. While establishing a parliamentary majority and governing the large democracy is a challenge, Borges' gravitas and personal charm will no doubt play an important role in keeping the republic on the way to progress" 
POLITICS_PRESTES_MAIA_BRA_DESC:0 "Maia is not a politican by trade, but rather a civil engineer thursted to the position after his sucess in planning and reparing the infrastructure in São Paulo's most affected areas by the civil war, and his plan to completely remodel that state's streets has made great strides in the last decade, which made him the man of the hour in these elections. His beliefs clashed with other, older politicians and less liberally inclined members of the party, but his urban remodelling and subsequent tenure as Mayor of São Paulo made him well known nation wide, and thus he was picked to lead the splinter liberal ticket. His lack of political experience, especially at the national arena, may make his government quite the eventful affair, as his plans to remodel the country's fiscal and infrastructure systems may very well find stiff resistance in parliament, even with his own party's views. However, the fact that a man that isnt an establishment politician managed to enter the Catete is seen well by most of the populace"

Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon was shocked to find after an expedition that Brazil's ruling Integralist party was not only plotting to restore the monarchy, but also had seemingly ordered his arrest. He took up arms, and was joined by many across the country who loathed the monarchist and populist rethoric of the Integralists, but still was at a severe strategic disadvantadge. However, his knowldege of local terrain and lifetime of military experience, coupled with uprisings dividing the attention of the oversteched federal govermnent, allowed his revolution to succeed. Now he rules as interim president, leading a process of de-intoxicating Brazil from the monarchist disease until the next elections come, and law and order are properly restored to the nation. "

Despite persistent requests by other officers, especially from those further to the right who see his moderate voice as needed, Isidoro has stated in no uncertain terms that his government is temporary, and he will step down as soon as the Union representatives and delegates meet to select a ruler.

POLITICS_JOAO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "João Mangabeira started out as a noteworthy defence attorney in Ilhéus, before turning to politics like his brother, former president Otávio. Early on in his career he was a close and passionate follower of Rui Barbosa, but after his mentor's passing, he carved a career of its own as a federal representative of the state of Bahia. A man with deeply rooted anti-authoritarian principles, he was a vocal supporter of Bahia's role in the civil conflict, and gained notoriety as a result. As his career went by, the continous and yet seemingly fruitless struggle of Brazil's poor brought him closer to the left, and while he certainly has some socialist views and allies in union and intellectual circles, he certainly is no Syndicalist. His plan for Brazil was to build a broad leftist front to oppose the current status quo, and his sucess was unexpected, but probably not unpredictable considering the social upheaval following Black Monday and the scandalous repression of labour movements nationwide. Now, he has to juggle the several disparate factions in his left front while keeping the ravenous opposition at bay, and it seems his presidency is certainly going to be as eventful as his brother's."

Having come to live permanently in Brazil after the civil war, which convinced him personally more than ever that a monarchy was needed by the people, he immediatly started to articulate politically towards his restoration, and his scheme has finally come to fruition as he has been crowned Pedro III of Brazil. He has been prepared all his life, from childhood tutors to lessons as an adult, for this station he considers his birthright, but few things could prepare a man for the tumultous times since Black Monday shattered the economic order of the world. While he certainly is thankful for the assitance of the Integralist movement in restoring him, his views towards the more radical wings of the party are not as positive as one could think, as their extreme views often clash with his milder ones."

POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "에드워드 윈저는 그의 아버지, 조지 5세의 죽음과 함께 오타와에서 왕위를 계승했습니다. 엄숙히 즉위한 이 젊은 왕은 흔적만 남은 제국의 옛 영광과 생디칼리스트 혁명가들에게 점거당한 왕국을 물려받았습니다. 의심할 여지 없이 에드워드 왕은, 무엇보다도 유니온 잭이 다시 브리튼 제도 위를 당당하게 날아 오르기를 희망하고 있습니다."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC:0 "영국 왕 에드워드 8세의 동생인 앨버트 윈저 공이 캐나다의 총독으로 임명되었습니다. 어린 시절 그는 눈에 띄는 말더듬이 때문에 조롱을 받았지만, 알버트는 현명하고 또한 근면한 사람이 되었습니다. 캐나다인들은 앨버트 총독의 인품을 높이 평가하고 있지만, 캐나다 정부의 많은 사람들 사이에서는 총독 임명이 캐나다 의회의 재량에 위임될 것이라는 기대가 있었기에 실망한 사람도 많았습니다. 하지만 일부 사람들의 실망에도 불구하고 앨버트는 좋은 평판을 받고 있습니다. 에드워드가 최근에 수복한 영국의 재건에 몰두하는 가운데, 앨버트는 캐나다가 적절하게 통치되도록 하기 위해 부지런히 고민해왔습니다."
POLITICS_ROBERT_POPHAM_DESC:0 "세계대전 기간에 왕립 공군 장성이었던 로버트 브룩-폽햄이 캐나다의 총독으로 임명되었습니다. 브룩-폽햄은 항상 철저한 인물이었고 왕립 공군을 영국군의 독립된 군으로서, 그리고 이후에 캐나다의 군대로서 설립하는데 필수적인 인물이었습니다. 캐나다 총독에 그가 임명되면서, 자재 부족이 줄어들고 효율이 크게 증가했습니다. 이것은 명백히 에드워드 왕이 임명한, 영국 혁명 이후 캐나다의 첫번째 총독인 브룩-폽햄의 업적입니다."

In 1891, his father was exiled for opposing President José Manuel Balmaceda. Despite his early opposition to the ruling authorities, he joined the Chilean naval academy in 1892. Exiled due to his socialist tendencies, he was chosen to perform a role as a liason in Great Britain, effectivelt just to keep him out of Chile. But there he took part in the Revolution, and during his exile, During the rule of President Ibañez Del Campo, Chile's economy worsened and in 1931 the country went bankrupt. Shortly after this, Ibañez was deposed when most of the army and navy mutinied, allowing for Grove's return to Chile and the proclamation of the Socialist Republic. His recent ascetion to the post of Chairman is one that clearly signals that both Military and Civil authorities in Chile consider conflict with Argentina nigh inevitable after years of support for the Patagonian rebels."

POLITICS_ELIZABETH_FLYNN_DESC:0 "할렘가에 있는 먼지투성이의 지하 사회주의 모임에서부터 엘리자베스 플린의 웅변가의 삶이 시작되었습니다. 뉴저지의 세계산업노동자동맹의 초창기 구성원인 플린은 노동조합 형성에 대한 정치적 분노의 무정함을 느꼈고 10번이나 당국에 체포되었습니다. 플린은 국제노동자 변호협회 이전에 파업자들을 위한 법적 변호를 위해 조직된 ACLU의 설립을 도왔습니다. 내전을 앞두고 플린은 서해안 공격 계획을 돕기도 했습니다. 플린이 징병 장려를 위해 중앙 위원회에 보낸 전시 연설이 플린으로 하여금 위원회의 수많은 양심적 병역 거부자들의 눈에 띄게 했습니다. 결국 플린은 충격적인 다크호스 후보로 미국을 이끌기 위해 선출되었습니다. 몇몇 사람들은 여성이 혁명의 최전선에 서는 것은 터무니없다고 생각했지만, 이 반항적인 처녀는 산업노동자동맹 설립 이후 내내 선두에 서서 싸웠으며 이제 그녀 자신이 생각하던 사회주의 미국을 건설할 준비가 되었습니다."
POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "노먼 토마스는 사회적 지위가 낮을 때이건 높을 때이건 사회주의에 헌신해왔습니다. 그는 신문팔이 소년에서부터 프린스턴 대학 우등을 거쳐 양심적 병역 거부자에 이르기까지의 인생을 살아왔습니다. 내전 이전의 그는 뉴욕시 시장이자 잭 리드의 부통령 후보로 일했었습니다. 전쟁 동안의 토마스는 자신의 평화주의적 사상을 통해 연방측 지역에 살고 있는 사회주의자들로 하여금 징병에 저항하도록 헌신했습니다. 전쟁이 끝난 후, 그는 자신의 학력과 잭 리드와의 친밀한 우정을 이용해 연방주의자들을 대신해서 헌법 회의에서 민주적 사회주의자들을 승리로 이끌기 위해 연설했습니다. 황금률 그 자체이자 행동하는 양심으로 불리는 노먼 토마스는 의장직에 올랐습니다."
POLITICS_EARL_BROWDER_DESC:0 "1891년 캔자스에서 태어난 브라우더는 열여섯살 때 열렬한 사회주의자가 되었습니다. 미국 사회당에 대한 브라우더의 집념은 흔들리지 않았고, 초창기에는 윌리엄 Z 포스터와의 우정을 통해 그는 생디칼리스트가 되었습니다. 그러나 세월이 흐르면서 두 사람의 사이가 멀어지기 시작했습니다. 포스터는 권위주의적 형태의 생디칼리즘을 선호했지만, 브라우더는 이 움직임에 점점 더 많은 한계을 보이기 시작했습니다. 브라우더에 따르면 유럽에서 적용되는 것과 같은 신념과 전략은 미국에는 적용될 수 없음을 미국 혁명이 증명했다고 합니다. 그의 신경제정책은 볼셰비즘으로부터의 영감, 맑스주의 재해석, 그리고 많은 독창적인 생각들로 구축되었습니다. 브라우더는 의회에서 끈질긴 산업노조 활동 경향을 종식시키고자 하며, 사회주의 국가 내에서 종교 활동을 도입하고자 합니다. 브라우더는 결코 미국 사회당을 저버린 적이 없지만, 새로운 권위주의 입장을 통해 그는 당이 자신을 결코 저버리지 않도록 만들려고 합니다."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_FOSTER_DESC:0 "A radical labor organizer who spearheaded the syndicalist movement in America, William Z Foster has practically become a legend on the American left. His leadership in the strikes of the early 20th century and his commitment that the Socialist Party of America adapt Syndicalist policies has cemented him as one of its chief ideologies. His famous manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America" has served as the guidebook for every aspiring Totalist in the country, containing Foster's culminated ideals for how to rebuild the nation of America into what it is today. With the recent victories of the Vanguard movement of the Combined Syndicates, Foster was uplifted to lead the new nation. Several of Foster's older, more socially ambitious ideas now come to the fore. This includes plans to reform the socialist human being as a whole, and to re-orient American morals towards the vanguard of socialism."
POLITICS_JAMES_CANNON_DESC:0 "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the socialist party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists made Cannon adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organize foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisers, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon would immediately start to build the momentum needed to run for president, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
POLITICS_CARLO_TRESCA_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family in Italy, Tresca's emigration to America became the first major step in a tumultuous life which saw him soon emerge as Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America. Having built up a famed reputation as an anarchist, a strike organizer and a community leader among Italian immigrants, Tresca became an integral figure within the IWW. His oratory and legal skills were put to use defending men such as Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as stopping the infiltration and manipulation of trade unions by the Italian Mafia. He spent much time vocally supporting the revolution in his homeland Italy, defending the merits, accomplishments and potentials of the Italian Socialist Republic to his fellow Italian-Americans. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Carlo Tresca played a key role in the takeover and new administration of New York City, he survived multiple assassination attempts and scores of protests against his campaign for being an Italian immigrant. His prior accomplishments within the Italian Socialist Federation and the IWW has now allowed Carlo Tresca to launch a successful campaign to become President."
POLITICS_ARTURO_GIOVANNITTI_DESC:0 "Born in Abruzzi Italy, Arturo was one of the hundreds of thousands who came to the United states seeking opportunity. Arturo instead found a ripe political climate for expanding workers’ rights. Arturo was there during the 1912 Textile Strike of Lawrence, Massachusetts, where his illegal arrest and subsequent trial in a metal cage became a rallying point for the New England IWW. Arturo was acquitted of all charges, and became a socialist activist, first opposing the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, then the US's entry into the war. During the revolution, Arturo led an Italian American brigade out of New England and into the CSA territory under hostile fire. A talent for speaking and poetry elevated his campaign. Ultimately he was elected President as a true citizen."
POLITICS_MEYER_LONDON_DESC:0 "Born in Tsarist Lithuania under the grip of Russian influence. Meyer's first ambition was to become a Talmudic scholar like his father. The adverse conditions of Russia forced Meyer's family to relocate to New York City, where Meyer became a printer. Printing for Yiddish publications, Meyer had fallen into one such group of radical intellectuals that encouraged him to become a lawyer. Starting in the 1890s, Mayer joined Eugene V. Deb's Social Democratic Party, and was a leading organizer of the 1910 New York Clockmakers Strike. A coalition ticket with Progressives allowed Meyer to become the first of many socialists in Congress. Meyer opposed the U.S's entry into the Weltkrieg, and yet aided the McAdoo administration in promoting militancy. Meyer even angered Jewish labor by promoting partisan Jewish organizations above Zionist labor groups. Meyer went undercover during the Crisis of 36, and re-emerged following the war championing many of the issues he was against. Meyer the pro-Zionist war hawk was much more popular, even against protesters claiming he couldn't run for President as an immigrant."
POLITICS_UPTON_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labor conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry, of which he declared "I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the "End Poverty In California" campaign. E.P.I.C as it came to be known was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing a E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
POLITICS_FRANK_LITTLE_DESC:0 "Born to a family of Oklahoma homesteaders, Frank Little moved to California in order to escape the miserable droughts that had ruined his family's land. Him and his brother both became ministers, but in 1905 Frank became a full-time organizer for the IWW. A proud wobbly, he soon struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and fought alongside her for the rights of unionized workers across the whole country. Frank narrowly survived two separate attempts at lynching by strike breakers, once in Wisconsin and a second time in Montana. Two instances of nearly being murdered caused Frank Little to lay low for several years, only beginning to show his face again around the mine wars of the early 1920s. His political activism was less provocative, and he avoided any more near-death experiences until the outbreak of the civil war. Although too hold to fight personally, Frank helped organize a series of militias across the Steel Belt, and was later nominated to serve in the new government. From this position, he could launch a campaign for the presidency, which the elderly union man narrowly won."
POLITICS_HARRY_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Harry Bridges was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1901. When he turned 15, he was first introduced to radical labor politics through the Australian branch of the IWW. Emboldened by his contacts with fellow socialists, along with seeing the general deplorable conditions of the poor around the world, he participated in his first general strike in Australia in 1917. Three years later, in 1920, he would move permanently to the US due to the more plentiful work there. He settled in San Fran where he joined other local activists in reviving the then-defunct International Longeshoremens Association. In 1934 a period of month-long negotiations between the twenty local branches of the ILA and the dock owners of SF broke down when two longshore workers were murdered. Bridges, the leading negotiator for the ILA during the standoff, convinced over 100 San Francisco unions to join together in a General Strike. The ILA fought the city to a standstill, and Harry Bridges was given credit for stopping further police violence. His later Presidential campaign often faced off against protesters who defied the new Amendment giving natural born citizenship to immigrants, and prevailed against them. Using this reputation, he launched a risky but successful campaigned that has lead him to the presidency."
POLITICS_FRANK_JOHNS_DESC:0 "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the second American civil war as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected president, of a whole new America!"
POLITICS_SEYMOUR_STEDMAN_DESC:0 "It was incomprehensible to many that a simple janitor would go on to become one of the Socialist Party of America's most prominent activists and legal advisers. Initially balancing his job as a janitor at the Northwestern University School of Law with taking evening classes, Stedman managed to pass the bar to became a lawyer in 1891. Although he was at first a democrat, the young Stedman became inducted into socialism when he helped defend Eugene V Debs during American Railway Union's great strike. His lifelong friendship to Debs saw him chosen as the SPA's vice presidential candidate on 1920, and after Debs' death he became a close advisor to Jack Reed. Having now outlived yet another close comrade, the old and somber Stedman has run a successful race to become the new president, intent on honoring his old friend's utopian dreams."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_RODRIGUEZ_DESC:0 "The son of a Spanish immigrant to Illinois, William Rodriguez made his living painting houses, until he could eventually afford to pursue a legal degree. Inspired by his brother in law, a radical journalist named J. Louis Engdahl to join the American Socialist party and move to Chicago. The young Rodriguez managed to win a race for the Chicago city council as a dark horse candidate, becoming the first socialist and first Hispanic to sit on the council. He soon managed to use his newfound position to attack the city's transit companies and to seek legal reforms. Although eventually ousted by a democratic and republican unity candidate, Rodriguez did not give up on politics. He continued to practice law and ran a successfully campaign in 1933 to become a judge. Building on a lifetime of legal and political experience, his next triumph came when he ran his most recent successful presidential campaign."
POLITICS_MORRIS_HILQUIT_DESC:0 "One of the oldest political figures in the Combined Syndicates, Hillquit was born in 1869, to a Jewish family living in Latvia. After his father lost his business, the young Morris and his dad crossed the Atlantic in search of a better life. Soon settled in the slums of New York, Hillquit would go on to found the Socialist Party of America alongside Victor Berger and Eugene V Debs. He ran for the senate in 1908 from New York City, garnering 21% of the votes. Despite this failure, he would later unsuccessfully run for mayor of NYC and afterwards help organize fellow socialist Meyer London's successful bid for congress. Despite suffering from numerous bouts of tuberculosis and frequent conflicts with the growing syndicalist wing of the SPA, Hillquit endured long enough to witness the revolution finally sweep through America. Although old and sickly, his seniority and eventful life has netted him a surprising victory in the latest presidential election. His age helped to invalidate dissenters who wanted a natural born citizen as President. Although some remain uncertain if he can finish his current term, President Hillquit has sworn he will serve the interests of all of America's proletariat, no matter his age or health."
POLITICS_EUGENE_DENNIS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Francis Xavier Waldron, and spending his early life as a laborer and IWW member in California, the young Waldron was driven into exile after the Californian Criminal Syndicalist Act nearly saw him imprisoned for revolutionary political activism. Fleeing to the Commune of France and taking up work as minor union politician, he became an important link between the Socialist Party of America and the Third Internationale. In 1935 he returned across the Atlantic, now hiding under the pseudonym "Eugene Dennis", to help organize Jack Reed's campaign in the coming presidential election. His services to Reed were soon rewarded with a series of influential positions within the Combined Syndicates, which served as the stepping stones for his own eventually presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ELMER_ALLISON_DESC:0 "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in Seattle's streets. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he has gladly pursued!"
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_NORD_DESC:0 "Elizabeth Nord grew up as the daughter of a family of poor English coal miners, having to spend her early teenage years toiling in a silk factory. Her family departed England a few years shy of the British Revolution, settling across the Atlantic in Rhode Island. In the United States Nord spent another decade as a factory worker during which she used her political finesse and determination to rise through the ranks of her local union, being elected Chairwoman. She became one of the key leaders of the Great Textile Strike of 1934, organizing the walkout of tens of thousands of workers across the country. On the outbreak of the Second civil war, she was a political representative of her union in Washington D.C, but quickly made her way across the frontlines to the Combined Syndicates of America. Repeating the same grueling political maneuvering that put her in charge of the Great Textile Strike, Elizabeth Nord has now risen to lead something far greater than a union or a strike, she has become the new President!"
POLITICS_DAVID_DUBINSKY_DESC:0 "Dubinsky came from the former Russian Empire to America, a Polish Jew who had spent his early life organizing bunds, leading strikes and campaigning for the Bolsheviks. These actions netted him a prison sentence in Siberia, but the young Dubinsky managed to miraculously escape back to western Russia and catch a ship to carry him across the Atlantic. Spending much time working in the factories of New York City, Dubinsky became increasingly alienated from the union bureaucracy around him, starting a long-time personal feud between him and the IWW. He initially saw unions as inherently apolitical platforms that should seek further co-operation with the right wing to uplift all workers despite political beliefs, and that compromises with the federal government and business sector were practically mandatory for a union's success. Dubinsky would change his opinion after witnessing first the Great Depression, then the steady rise of Huey Long and finally the outbreak of the American civil war. Although he never made amends with the "union bureaucrats", Dubinsky ceased to compromise with the right wing and capitalism, taking on more politically extreme views. When the civil war finally ended he had been singing the praises of the new America, and already planted the seeds for a political career. Despite his controversial past, it appears David Dubinsky has now been able to reap what he has sown, rising to the position of President in spite of protests from old nativists who resist the proclamation giving him natural born rights."
POLITICS_JOHN_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labor movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the steel belt. Although he initially bickered with William Z Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
POLITICS_LUDWIG_KATTERFELD_DESC:0 "Born in Strasbourg under the German Empire and sent away to live with family in America at just 10 years of age, where he later ran away from home, Ludwig Katterfeld had a harsh and formative upbringing. After escaping his extended family, he took up work as a farmhand in Kansas, spending his teenage years balancing hard labour with honing his impressive oratory skills and sharp intellect. The next two decades were a turbulent time for Katterfeld, seeing him become a professed socialist and move from state to state to launch new political ambitions. After graduating college in 1910 he moved to Chicago and lead his own short-lived socialist party, the "Lyceum Bureau". He became involved with the Socialist Party of Washington and in 1916 launched a failed gubernatorial bid with them. In 1922 he was the provisional secretary of the Socialist Party of America, and later a representative in their behalf to the Third Internationale. It was in Paris he met Jack Reed, whom he accompanied back to America the very next year. In 1923 both men played a key role in the brief, radical Seattle Commune. The events of the commune compelled the bitter and austere Katterfeld to go underground, breaking with Reed's desire to go into mainstream electoral politics. From there on Katterfeld worked as an independent activist, not resurfacing until the Civil War. He did not have a chance to reconnect with Reed until the closing days of the revolution, with the latter on his deathbed. Compelled to honor his old friendship to Reed and armed with a lifetime of revolutionary experience, Katterfeld has launched into the spotlight with a narrow victory in the recent presidential race."
POLITICS_HENNING_BLOMEN_DESC:0 "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organize the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
POLITICS_JOHN_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Initially a French immigrant, Bernard worked nearly a decade of his life in the iron mines of Minnesota, later enlisting in the army. He served along the Mexican Border during the Mexican Revolution, a year later returning to Minnesota but soon discovering himself to be blacklisted from employment because his trade union activism. Pursuing a career in firefighting, then as a politician, Bernard managed to be elected to the House of Representatives on the ticket of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1936. While in office, he became more and more aligned with Jack Reed's popular front of socialists, and began to campaign for friendlier relations between America and the Commune of France. Distinguishing himself as a diligent proletariat and cunning politician, John Bernard has gone a step further and made a successful run for presidency."
POLITICS_OAKLEY_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a position of Docent at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming Civil War abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
POLITICS_BAYARD_RUSTIN_DESC:0 "Born in Pennsylvania, in the year of 1912, Rustin was raised in a family deeply affiliated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was personally acquainted with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, developing left leaning beliefs at an early age. This best showed in 1936 when he organized a student strike at Wilberforce University, which he was expelled over. Cast adrift, the young Rustin moved to New York City where he joined the Young People's Socialist League and got to meet Norman Thomas and A. Phillip Randolph. With the outbreak of the civil war, Bayard Rustin became a political organizer and campaigner for the Combined Syndicates championing better race relations, increased desegregation, and the immediate overturning of Jim Crow in the newly liberated southern states. Now, decades after the revolution he has made his daring bid for the presidency despite the fact that Rustin's youth, skin color and known homosexual relationships have for long been targets of slander and ridicule. Although one might expect any one of those three to have stopped him, he has powered through regardless and been elected the first African-American head of state in American history."
POLITICS_DARLINGTON_HOOPES_DESC:0 "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers, during his time at boarding school he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian Socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian Socialist, Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labor in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
POLITICS_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Marine, General and Senator Smedley Butler has done the unthinkable, in the revolution's darkest moment he has overthrown the would-be usurpers and traitors in the Centralist clique, and kept the flame of liberty alive. The old general has been an invaluable warrior for the Combined Syndicates, and his latest startling victory has endeared him to the population tenfold. Although Butler has confided to friends and political allies that he is uneasy to now be in the spotlight, he has agreed to taken on the job as the temporarily acting president of the new America until the scars torn open by totalism can once again be healed."

POLITICS_MANUEL_BISBE_DESC:0 "Among the founders of the Cuban Authentic Party, Manuel Bisbé Alberni and other more moderate members left the organisation shortly before the bloodbath of 1935, and like many other ex-Authentics, joined with the Unionistas. Rumors circulated during the Havana Strike that Bisbé was directly involved with some moderate dissident groups, and while such speculation was never confirmed, Bisbé's appointment to boss of the Unionista Party following Rafael Trejo's retirement was almost certainly motivated his favorability among the dissatisfied."
POLITICS_MARIO_GARCIA_MENOCAL_DESC:0 "President from 1913 to 1921, many Cubans look back on Menocal's time in office with great fondness. Before the scandals of Zayas and the tyranny of Machado, the man remains one of Cuba's most respected heads of state. Following the revolution of 1928 and worried with the nation's political direction, Menocal re-entered politics and was elected to the Cuban senate. There, he and his new National Democratic Association allied with the remenants of the old Liberal Party to oppose, at least ostensibly, the military and Unionistas alike."
POLITICS_RAMON_GRAU_MARTIN_DESC:0 "As a professor at the University of Havana's medical school, Grau with other dissidents within the faculty and student body to resist the rule of Gerardo Machado. While Grau was not directly involved in organizing the mass student protests which catalyzed the revolution of 1928, he and his supporters quickly emerged as a powerful political force in the chaotic time immediately thereafter. A staunch nationalist, he was far from satisfied with the post-revolutionary status quo and while he initially supported the Unionistas in their power struggle against the military, his fervor and ever-increasing disdain for the socialist-bloc led to his utilizing extra-legal means to achieve his goals. In cooperation with army officers disaffected with the leadership of General Diaz, Grau's politically convenient thugs grew into a radical bonafide paramilitary and Grau turned more and more from his democrat ideals, his anger growing with his authoritarianism.\nAmidst the chaos following the election of 1935, Grau, now operating from the countryside where government rule had all but collapsed, hardened into the man he is today; both an idealist and a tyrant, steadfast yet so quick to compromise his beliefs, Ramón Grau San Martín is a walking contradiction."
POLITICS_LAZARO_PENA_DESC:0 "The young Lazaro Peña succeeded Sandalio Junco as boss of the CNOC totally inexperienced. Peña's meteoric rise in the short time since caught many among even Cuba's left off guard. An advocate of complete collectivisation and industrial development, Peña wears the moribund label of 'communist' with pride. Despite this, the CNOC and its leadership both past and present, have both embraced many aspects of European syndicalism and paradoxically call for cultivation of a stronger Cuban national identity in an internationalist context."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GUITERAS_DESC:0 "As leader of the Cuban Socialist Party following the Cuban revolution of 1928, Guiteras was a thorn in the side of Cuba's military kingmakers and instrumental in the survival of the party and socialism in general in Cuba following the events of 1935. Now, as chairman of the broad 'Socialist Movement', successor to the old party, and President of Cuba, Guiteras will undoubtedly be equally involved in shaping the future of the nation. While Guiteras is a relatively orthodox syndicalist, he possesses his own unique ideological quirks which could be crucial to the nation's ultimate fortune."
POLITICS_JUAN_HERNANDEZ_DESC:0 "Often compared to Nicaragua's Sandino, Juan Blas Hernández waged a years-long guerilla war in Cuba's southern hills. He is first and foremost a man of the people, and more than willing to fight and bleed for the sake of the nation's least fortunate. Now in power, President Hernández seeks not only to live up to his grandiose rhetoric, but the larger-than-life reputation he has garnered among many in the Cuban peasantry."
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TREJO_DESC:0 "As a young law student at the University of Havana, Rafael Trejo González grew increasingly disillusioned with the authoritarian regime of Gerardo Machado Morales. He joined the newly founded anti-Machado 'University Student Directory', established along the lines of the defunct 'University Student Federation', as well as the equally disaffected 'Law Students Association'. By late 1927 he had become influential in the former and the President of the latter. Trejo's impassioned yet collected denunciations of Machado and his influence within the university as well as his close association with Socialist disciples of exiled former student leader, Julio Mella McPartland, led to his forced dismissal following pressure from Machado's government. In response, Trejo led demonstrations in Havana and with the support of elements of the Cuban Army, overthrew Machado. Thereafter, Trejo, with the support of the military under the presumption that he would be easily controlled on account of his age, was appointed President instead of his older colleagues within the new caretaker government. Despite becoming President of Cuba just after his 18th Birthday and amidst rising tensions between his more extreme coalition partners, Trejo effectively guided the nation through the tumultuous years that followed his revolution."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_GOMEZ_DESC:0 "The son of Cuba's second president, José Gómez, Miguel Gómez was first elected to national public office during the Machado era. While he begrudgingly followed the Liberal Party line and lent Machado his support, he was among the most vocal supporters within the legislature of the student demonstrations that toppled the Machado regime. Following the success of the student revolution and the collapse of the Liberal Party, Gómez founded the Republican Party along with other moderate members within the defunct Liberal Party's right-wing. Opposed to undue regulation, Gómez envisions a Cuba enriched by a flourishing financial sector and booming trade with the wider world."
POLITICS_CARLOS_MENDIETA_DESC:0 "Senate President Mendieta succeeded Clemente Vazquez as President of Cuba following the latter's assassination, and Vazquez's shoes have proven hard to fill. Regardless, Mendieta, though calls for reform abound, even from within his own party, attempts to maintain the character of the executive established under his authoritarian predecessor."
POLITICS_JOSE_BARNET_DESC:0 "Following a long and illustrious career as a diplomat, Jose Agrapino Barnet was appointed as President by an outgoing Carlos Mendieta. While many assumed his Presidency would be a fleeting 'lame duck', Barnet approaches his position with a degree of professionalism rarely seen in Cuba's cutthroat political atmosphere."
POLITICS_MARTIN_TAMAYO_DESC:0 "As a junior officer stationed near the Cuban Presidential Palace, Martin Diaz first came to prominence at the head of a contingent of soldiers who joined with the student revolution of 1928. Finding himself at the forefront of a rapidly coalescing faction within the military and granted the rank of General, the merely thirty year old Diaz soon became the most powerful individual in Cuba, even more influential in the nation's politics than the President himself. Now, years later as President in his own right, Diaz stands nearly unopposed as the luminous sun around which Cuban politics orbit."
POLITICS_CLEMENTE_VAZQUEZ_DESC:0 "Clemente Vazquez was among president Machado's closest confidants and the President of the Senate for most of Machado's tenure, and despite many close calls, survived multiple attempts of his life following Machado's downfall. Unlike so many of old Liberal party, Vazquez held fast to the authoritarian model for the presidency established by Machado. Thanks to American brokerage of several informal deals with General Diaz, Vazquez returned to Cuban politics after only a short stint laying-low in the American embassy, and quickly found his feet. As President, Vazquez continues to emulate his older mentor, and many Cubans find his rule to be nearly indistinguishable from that of Machado."
POLITICS_JULIO_MELLA_DESC:0 "Grandson of Dominican hero, Matías Mella, Julio Mella had his first run in with the law as a first year university student during the tenure of president Zayas. As President of the ideologically socialist University Students Federation, Mella attempted to resist the authoritarian regime of Gerado Machado. For this, he was exiled to Mexico for the next eleven years. Upon his return, Mella quickly re-established his position within the Cuban left and brought with him a new ideology known as 'transformationism' influenced by Mexican agrarian socialist strains of thought. As President, Mella seeks to turn Cuba into a model for 'transformationism' for the world, no matter the cost or who may attempt to stand in his way."
POLITICS_CARLOS_CESPEDES_DESC:0 "Carlos de Céspedes, son of the Cuban independence hero of the same name, spent decades in politics and the Cuban diplomatic service. While ostensibly loyal to Machado during that pivotal tyrant's tenure, Céspedes secretly worked to undermine his regime, coordinating closely with other disaffected Liberal party members. Soon after the student revolution, Céspedes returned to elected office with a stint in the Senate, wherein he founded the New Liberal Party to unite like-minded former Liberals who with the dissolution of the Liberal Party lacked any formal association. As president, Céspedes looks to return Cuba to the early days of the Zayas regime, without the alleged corruption of course, and with a consciousness for often overlooked social and political realities."
POLITICS_RAUL_ROA_DESC:0 "Grandson of a decorated Mambí, Raúl Roa first developed his revolutionary socialist ideals as a student activist against the regime of Gerado Machado. Upon his release from prison, he worked closely with extralegal socialist opposition groups and the ideologically mixed 'University Student Directory' at the University of Havana. While not a direct participant of the protests which precipitated Machado's ousting, he found a platform writing for various left-wing publications, gain a good degree of celebrity among Cuban socialists. While Roa was only appointed to the office of the Presidency as part of a compromise between Cuba's feuding socialist factions, he possesses a knack for leadership and public speaking beyond his years."
POLITICS_ALBERTO_BAYO_DESC:0 "Expelled from the Cuban Air corps for pistol-dueling another airman, Alberto Bayo joined the Spanish Legion and fought in that nation's colonial war in northern Morocco. Returning to Cuba in 1932 following the dissolution of the short-lived Spanish Republic, Bayo joined with the rebel Juan Blas, training guerillas to fly whatever small aircraft they managed to capture. Eventually, Bayo relationship with Blas grew to the extent that each man became the other's closest confident. With Blas's untimely 'departure' from the struggle, Bayo took up leadership of those who would still pledge their loyalty to the wider movement Blas had led."
POLITICS_SANDALIO_JUNCO_DESC:0 "A close associate of Julio Mella's and exiled along with him to Mexico in 1925, Junco managed to secretly return to Cuba after the Cuban student revolution and eventually rose to the leadership of the CNOC, which still retained the ideological character it had possessed in 1925. Despite working with other socialist groups out of necessity, Junco disagreed deeply with the ideology and personal character of other socialist leader such as Antonio Guiteras and Juan Blas. Eventually forced to step down from his position as chairman of the CNOC by disaffected younger members, Junco retained a large of degree of influence within the organisation and the 'Comunista' faction of the Cuban Socialist Movement. As President, Junco seeks total collectisation of land and the nation's rapid forced indutrial development."
POLITICS_TINA_MODOTTI_DESC:0 "Noted photographer of Italian origin, Tina Modotti, came to Mexico in 1922 to follow a Mexican lover. Years later, she met and, out of character with her history of moving from one affair to the next, eventually married Cuban exile, Julio Mella. Upon the Cuban socialist revolution, Modotti returned with her new husband to the island, helping to re-establish his political career from the moment her feet first touched Cuban soil. After climbing through the ranks of her husband's government, Modotti succeeded him upon his death, becoming Cuba's first female head of state. She remains committed to her husband's transformationist ideology and authoritarian style of governance."

The king has thus guided Denmark through the Weltkrieg, in which the nation remained neutral and into the interwar, presiding the political shift that composed the rise of the social democrats of Thorvald Stauning in 1924. It is said that the king is sceptical about the prime minister and his party, but that he accepts their position in government in the knowledge that he can use his reserve power should excesses occur.\n\nMany have considered that the fact that this has still not happened after 12 years means that the king eventually accepted the democratic parliamentarism that has been in place since the ascension of the Deuntzer cabinet in 1901."

While in France, his views became increasingly coloured by French orthodox syndicalism, and upon his departure for the Dominican Republic in 1928, he had become a fervent supporter of Emile Pouget\nIn the Dominican Republic, his early efforts to promote syndicalism were mostly ineffective, but he managed to cultivate a small and devoted following, becoming the face of the Syndicalist movement in his adopted country."
POLITICS_PERDRO_HENRIQUEZ_URENA_DESC:0 "While slandered by political opponents for his marriage to the sister of Mexican Syndicalist, Vicente Lombardo Toledano, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, son of former president Francisco Henríquez Carvajal, returned to the Dominican Republic after years abroad to a great degree of fanfare. Despite comparisons to his radical brother-in-law, however, Henríquez is by no means a syndicalist; the principled writer, is however, more than willing to work any across the political spectrum who subscribe to the view that the Dominican Republic, and indeed all of Latin America, should be entirely free of imperialist influence, and able to fully choose their own destiny."
POLITICS_JUAN_JIMENES_GRULLON_DESC:0 "Juan Jimenes Grullón, son of former president Juan Jimenes Pereyra, despite the decline of progressivism in the Dominican Republic during the American occupation, is a true believer of the ideals of his father's Jimenistas. The younger Jimenes entered politics soon after returning to the Dominican Republic in 1929 from Germany, and soon established a small but devoted following."
POLITICS_ESTRELLA_URENA_DESC:0 "Rafael Estrella Ureña, while ideologically a social and economic reformist, gained a great deal of infamy even before the American occupation for his seemingly endless ambition and lust for political power. Since the end of the occupation, Estrella's name has only become further tainted by his willingness to work closely with both the military and members of the nation's economic elite."
POLITICS_MARTINEZ_REYNA_DESC:0 "Virgilio Martínez Reyna was essential to the 1924 election of Horacio Vásquez Lajara as the Dominican Republic's first president since the American Occupation. In his own presidential tenure, he has been equally central to the nation's incessant political turmoil. While popular and far less corrupt than his predecessors, Martínez's failure to quell discontent amongst the nation's economic elite and even begin to address the political power of the Army precipitated the nation's political direction thereafter.\nIdeologically, Martínez draws heavily on a uniquely populous Catholic corporatism, and while indeed not entirely authoritarian, is more than willing to undermine the foundations of Dominican democracy if need be."

POLITICS_KRISHNA_MENON_DESC:0 "Krishna Menon, often accused of harbouring sympathies for socialism and the Indian National Congress, has nonetheless, become one of India's most prominent political figures. Menon is a masterful manipulator, playing the game of Indian politics much like a grandmaster would play a round of chess. With the death of his political ally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Menon was forced to step out from the shadows, and become the face of the moderate left in India. Menon is as distrustful of the West as of political rivals, fearing any continued association with the remnants of the British Empire could lead India to ruin."

Khan began his political career as an ally of leftist Muhammad Jinnah, but drifted further from Jinnah with time. He joined the conservative Unionist Party, which had split from the Jinnah's Home Rule Party over dissatisfaction with Jinnah's leadership, and disagreement with the Party's endorsement of land redistribution; this split between Jinnah and Khan has created a political rift amongst Indian Muslims."
POLITICS_CHHOTU_RAM_DESC:0 "Chhotu Ram, after helping to found the Unionist Party, withdrew from politics to focus on social work. Ram's work led to a marked increase in the standard of living of some of the most destitute people of Punjab, and the name 'Chhotu Ram' was soon on the lips of a great many Indians. Upon his return to politics, Ram set out to reform the Unionist Party, which had evolved from an alliance of Punjabi Jats and Muslims into an organisation for the protection of the rural nobility of northern India."

He gained a well-respected reputation as a medical professional and public figure, even managing to become Mayor for the town of Quito in 1924, and being chosen later as a deputy for his hometown. His meteoric rise to popularity was halted by the Conservatives taking over the country, frustrating any attempts by Ayora to become a candidate for President.

In his time as President, he managed to approve an economic plan by the Ecuadorian banker Victor Emilio Strada, which has slowly but steadily improved the economic situation of Ecuador.

In 1927, inspired by Juan Albamocho, she'd join the Movimiento Maximista Ecuatoriano, and begin organizing the natives in order to acquire better rights. Dolores managed to stage a successful insurrection in 1931, but would be crushed quickly by Gallo's forces. In 1934 she decided to join forces with Ricardo Paredes, and have since then both tried to change Ecuadorian society.

As such, she left the PSE and joined the 'Movimiento de Liberacion Ecuatoriano', and has since then climbed steadily through the ranks with her charisma until becoming their leader.

He joined the Partido Conservador Ecuatoriano, where he was even named Vice-President of Ibarra despite his differences with the Argolla clique, which has gained him an honourable reputation within the populace.

With his coup against the civilian government in December of 1931, he's been bombarded with tough decisions which led to the Salvadoran Uprising in 1932.

However, mounting unrest in the army have turned Salinas into the voice of opposition against Martinez.

Having defected from Martinez' forces during the Second Western Uprising, it almost seemed like the General was a defender of democracy. Apparently, He has other plans for the Salvadorian democracy, ones that differed greatly from the PL and the PND. Seeing the Red Menace looming over Central America, Castro took advantage of the government's refusal to crack down on rebellious military elements and secretly allied with them, waiting for the Laboristas to make a wrong move to take over El Salvador. Now that he is in control of the nation, he'll purge the Syndicalists from any position of power, all while trying to provide some semblance of democracy to the populace to avoid a new uprising, even if this 'Democracy' will prove to be nothing but a ruse..."
POLITICS_ALFONSO_MOLINA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Quiñónez Molina has had a long political career by Salvadorian standards. He had been learning the ropes of governance from his time as Vice-President for his Brothers-in-law Carlos Meléndez and Jorge Meléndez from 1915 to 1918 and then from 1919 to 1923 respectively; becoming Provisional President in 1914 and 1919 first and then being elected as Constitutional President in 1923. Public outraged ensued after his election, with plenty of media outlets considering his rule as a pseudo-monarchy which came to be known as the Meléndez-Quiñones Dynasty. Despite the bad press though, his rule saw the greatest coffee boom ever registered in El Salvador's history, making the nation reach record levels of economic prosperity and catapulting Molina's popularity to new heights. However, many episodes of repression during his rule had severely damaged his reputation and was forced to step down when his term was over. The hardships El Salvador has been forced to endure in his absense have made many miss the times of prosperity that he brought, and with a lack of any other strong liberal candidates, the PND decided to contact Molina once again to lead the liberal coalition, to which Molina has gladly accepted. Now that he's back in power, he has promised to do anything in his power to deliver prosperity back to the Salvadorian nation and its people."
POLITICS_ARTURO_ARUAJO_DESC:0 "Arturo Araujo Fajardo studied to become an engineer in England, where he became a strong follower of the British Labour Party's policies before the Weltkrieg. Upon his return to El Salvador, he quickly became a follower of Alfredo Masferrer and his ideology, 'Vitalismo' and in 1930 he made up his mind to finally take part in Salvadorian politics officially and formed his own party, the Partido Laborista, which received immediate support thanks to Masferrer's endorsement. The Laboristas won the 1931 election, and Araujo's career seemed to have practically skyrocketed overnight. However, economic hardship, social instability and opposing the interests of the army and the rural oligarchy only weakened Araujo's position further and further. His presidency came to an end when his Vice-President and Minister of War, Maximiliano Hernandez Martínez made a successful coup d'etat in December 2nd, 1931, sidelining Araujo from any politically relevant position and ending democracy in El Salvador. However, with the Second Western Rebellion being successful and Araujo having been chosen to lead his country for the transition to a full democracy once again, he has become a beloved figure in El Salvador, and his rule is bound to see progressive reforms and welfare be introduced to the nation."

He'd later volunteer to help the Zapatista forces after the Plan of Agua Prieta came into effect, where he would meet who would be one of his closest friends for years, Augusto Cesar Sandino. He would continue his career of political activism, and would later help Sandino with his fight in Nicaragua. However, with time, Martí grew further and further apart from Sandino, with them disagreeing more and more often on the fate of their countries should their revolutions succeed. Martí eventually gew further and further appart, and their relationship reached a breaking point in 1929 where Martí tried to punch Sandino in a drunken rampage. Despite having apologized formally with Sandino several times, he decided to return to El Salvador in 1930 and start leading the revolutionary movement by himself. His time would come in 1932 where he tried to lead the First Western Uprising, but after being delivered a crushing defeat by Martinez, he fled to Mexico to continue preparing for the revolution in El Salvador. Now that he's in power, he'll do his best to brind about the European-style Syndicalist Utopia he has dreamed of, even if this dream may seem far off for an agrarian region like Central America..."

Having lived in exile in family estates for most of his life, he was forced to leave his birthplace in France following the Revolution, but even before that the french state harried his family for their ties to Austria-Hungary during the Weltkrieg. While he technically acted as a regent for his demented brothers, Elias has been long the de-facto head of the house, and his ascension to the throne of the now restored throne is little more than a fait-accompli of dynastic politics.

POLITICS_ANTONIO_SOTO_FOP_DESC:0 "안토니오 소토 카날레조는 1897년 스페인 라코루냐 주의 페롤시에서 태어났습니다. 그의 아버지는 그가 매우 어렸을 때 돌아가셨고, 그는 13살 때 그의 형과 함께 아르헨티나로 이주해야만 했습니다. 그는 이미 10대 때 '세라노-멘도사' 여행 극단과 함께 여행하던 중 만난 사람들에 의해 아나키스트적 이상에 노출되었습니다. 그는 추부트 지방의 트렐레우에서 열린 무역 직원 파업에 참가했는데, 이 파업은 그가 파업자들과 함께 싸우면서 공공연한 저항으로 변했습니다. 비록 그 저항은 진압되었지만, 그는 미래의 폭동에 대한 귀중한 경험을 얻었습니다.\n\n 두 번째 파타고니아 파업이 일어났을 때, 부유한 지주들이 파업자들과 정부 간에 합의된 요구들을 무시하기로 결정하자, 그는 파업자들과 함께 연합하고 반란을 조직하기로 결정했습니다. 이 파업은 '라 아니타' 농장의 대치 상황으로 이어졌고, 그곳에서 소토는 불타는 연설로 환멸에 빠진 노동자들을 불러 모았고 바렐라 중령이 이끄는 군대를 가까스로 저지했습니다. 그의 군대는 더 나은 근무 환경과 열성적인 이상주의 모두를 원하는 단순한 노동자들과 함께 자라기 시작했고, 후에 FOP의 창설을 이끈 사건들에서 알프레도 폰테의 군대와 합류했습니다. '엘 갈리시아'는 전 세계의 노동자들과 아나키스트들에게 전설적인 인물이 되었으며, 그는 필요하다면, 정의와 평등의 아나키스트적 이상을 가능한 한 아르헨티나 사회에 평화적인 방법으로 가져오려고 노력할 것입니다."
POLITICS_MANUEL_BALDOMERO_UGARTE_DESC:0 "마누엘 발도메로 우가르테는 1875년 아르헨티나의 수도 부에노스 아이레스에서 태어났습니다. 부유한 가정에서 태어난 그는 '부에노스 아이레스 국립 대학'에 입학하여 열렬한 독서자이자 열성적인 작가가 되었습니다. 1897년, 그는 공부를 계속하기 위해 파리를 여행했습니다. 그는 철학과 사회학 과정을 배웠으며 1894년 미국이 쿠바에 개입하자 장 조레스의 뒤를 이어 제국주의에 대한 증오심을 드러내기 시작했습니다. 그는 아르헨티나에 있는 젊은 작가 그룹에 가입했고 그들은 모두 사회당을 열광시켰습니다. 그러나 후안 B. 후스토의 사회당의 보수적인 지도부는 곧 사회당 내에서 더 많은 경쟁파를 형성 한 젊은 그룹을 적대시했습니다.\n\n FOP가 분리되었을 때, 우가르테는 후스토의 행동을 참을 수 없었고, 새로 태어난 나라로 떠나기로 결심했습니다. 우가르테는 혁명적인 이상에 헌신하는 반면, 그의 동료 혁명가들과도 많은 차이점이 있습니다. 그는 종교의 자유와 국가들의 개념을 확고히 수호하며 아르헨티나 국가와 문화에 대한 그의 사랑을 재확인했습니다. 그러나 그는 또한 남미에 대한 제국주의를 막기 위해 다른 사회주의자들과 힘을 합치는 것을 믿고 있으며, 그렇게 함으로써 그는 자신의 깃발 아래 아메리카를 통합하려고 노력할 것입니다."
POLITICS_FANNY_JABCOVSKY_DESC:0 "패니 잡코브스키는 1911년 아르헨티나, 코르도바, 산 프란시스코에서 태어났습니다. 그녀는 1925년 14살 때 직물 작업장에서 일하기 시작했지만 나중에 음악 선생님이 되기 위해 직장을 그만두었습니다. 그리고 나서 그녀는 저널리스트 에두아르도 에델만을 만났고, 그녀는 1934년에 공산주의자가 되라고 자신을 설득한 작가 레오니다스 바를레타와 알바로 윤케를 만났습니다. 그녀는 자신의 새로운 이상과 현재 삶이 충돌하는 것을 발견하고 남편과 함께 FOP에 가기로 결심했습니다. 그녀의 여행은 길고 힘든 것이었고, 아르헨티나 국경 수비대가 그들을 막았을 때, 그들은 리오 네그로 강을 간신히 건넜습니다. 개입한 FOP의 국경 수비대와의 전초전에서 패니는 살아남았습니다.\n\n 그 이후, 그녀는 다른 혁명가들이 FOP로 탈출하고 반동적 공격으로부터 그것을 보호하기 위해 FOP의 국경 수비대에 합류했습니다. 그녀는 1934년과 1936년 사이의 많은 국경 분쟁에 참가하여, FOP의 대중들 사이에서 많은 경험과 인기를 얻은 군대의 적극적인 일원이 되었습니다. 이제 그녀가 FOP를 이끌고 있으니, 그녀는 자신의 군대 경험을 이용해 제국주의를 물리치고, 국제주의의 기치 아래 남아메리카를 통합하려고 노력할 것입니다."

POLITICS_VARELA_PATA_DESC:0 "헥터 베니그노 바렐라는 20년대에 파타고니아 파업을 탄압한 책임이 있습니다. 파업자들과의 첫 만남 동안, 그는 노동자들이 그들의 고용주들로부터 더 나은 권리를 되찾는 것이 옳다고 판단하였고, 관대하게 그들이 계속하도록 허락했습니다. 그러나, 두 번째 파타고니아 파업 때는, 그의 무자비한 무리는, 그가 파업자들에게 무조건 항복을 요구함에 따라, 심지어 소토가 합의에 이르기 위해 보낸 전령들을 처형시켰습니다. 그러나 그는 폭동을 진압하지 못했고, 그의 실패는 그를 군대에서 좌천시켰습니다. 그러나 그 후 그는 애국당과 긴밀히 협력하여 반란군 전술에 귀중한 경험을 얻었으며, 파타고니아의 군사 총독이 된 지금, 그는 철권으로 통치하고 그를 모욕한 적이 있는 사람들을 사냥할 것입니다."
POLITICS_FONTE_FOP_DESC:0 "'엘 토스카나'로 더 잘 알려진 알프레도 폰테는 파타고니아를 돌아다니며 두 번째 파타고니아 파업 시기에 고립된 농장, 주택 그리고 심지어 마을까지 공격한 아나키스트 도적단의 지도자였습니다. 그는 그 기간 동안 미카엘라 펠드만 데 에체베히에르를 만났으며 그녀는 그에게 군사 전략을 가르쳤고, 도적을 적절한 장군이 되게 했습니다. 1923년, 그는 파소 이바네즈에서 소토를 만났습니다. 파타고니아 봉기가 걷잡을 수 없이 커지면서, 그들 둘은 함께 일하고 그들의 차이점을 해결하기로 동의했습니다. 소토는 FOP를 이끌었지만 폰테는 FOP의 창설을 상징하는 사건들 중 하나에서 군대를 이끌었습니다. 하지만, 그는 예전 방식을 버리지 않았고 국경을 넘어 마을들을 약탈하는 모습이 여러 번 목격되었습니다. 이제 그가 권력을 잡았으니, 그의 싸이코적이고 폭력적인 태도와 전체주의적 견해는 FOP의 얼굴을 영원히 바꿀 것입니다."

POLITICS_JACQUES_ROMAIN_DESC:0 "Jacques Roumain prolific poet, once a close associate of both liberal and Noirist writers alike, together with a close-knit group of like minded ideologes, founded the Haitian Syndicalist Party and began the formalisation of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his liberal and Noirist once-allies in the process, the movement he would create propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno."
POLITICS_GEORGES_RIGAUD_DESC:0 "A leader of protests against the discriminatory policies the United States imposed upon Haitian education system, Rigaud was beaten to inch of his life at the hands of American Marines as a young student in Port-Au-Prince.

Borno, however, would prove entirely willing to not only cooperate with the United States, but work hand in hand to ensure their mutual success. During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, managed to eliminate Haiti's crippling debts, complete unprecedented infrastructure projects, and stabilise the country's political turmoil. With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."
POLITICS_JOHN_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell's is loyal only to the United States."

Ta Thu Thau became a prominent activist in Saigon in the mid-1920s and joined the League in its darkest days. After the split in 1931 gave another heavy blow to the League, Ta Thu Thau rose to power. This sharp intellectual has intentionally modelled Ho Chi Minh's leading style since his assuming of the title of Chairman, trying to calm factional tensions and strengthen solidarity. The recovery of the League from the collapse largely credited to his efforts. Now, he is determined to achieve the unfulfilled dream of the martyrs——build syndicalism in Indochina."

POLITICS_TAN_MALAKA_DESC:0 "Tan Malaka has always walked a tight rope between orthodox and heterodox beliefs. In religion, Tan's support of Sarekat Islam, an egalitarian Islamist organization, contrasted against the hierarchy of religious leadership. His commitment towards socialist thought also contrasted against the prevailing trade unionism that was growing in Europe. Between the lines Tan has pushed cooperation towards a brighter future."

Upon his return to Indonesia, he attempted to join the PNI. Issues with the self-sufficiency message expressed by Sukarno led to him exit from the party. In defiance of the ban on socialist parties imposed by the Dutch, Sutan created the PSI under his own very loose definition of socialism."

Upon his return he saw both the apathy of Muslim authorities and the oppression of the Dutch as intolerable. Hasyim used this anger to ascend through the NU to transform the relationship between Islamic teachers and their students from directional to mutual."
POLITICS_MUNAWAR_MUSSO_DESC:0 "Musso was one of the leaders of the revolutionaries in 1925, a revolution inspired by the British one which was swiftly crushed by the colonial authorities and eventually resulted in the destruction of the PKI, forcing Musso to flee to the People's Republic of Bengal, from where he got into touch with Totalist thinkers from Europe. Convinced by the revolutionary ideas of this new movement, Musso hosted a reading and translation of the Totalist Charter among Insulindian exiles in Calcutta, subsequently forming the Partai Totalis Insulindia (PTI) that was to be the successor of the PKI. This definitively alienated Tan Malaka and his followers as the PTI rejected collaboration with Muslims towards independence, setting the stage for a permanent split in Insulindian socialism."
POLITICS_SEMAUN_DESC:0 "While many other Insulindian independence leaders avoided deportation by the Dutch, a group of vocal trade unionists lead by Semaun were caught trying to organize a trade union meeting in Surabaya and deported to the Legation Cities. From this exile Semaun grew in power by drawing attention to the miserable working conditions in factories. As his trade union was becoming more and more popular with Malayan immigrants, distance support from Sarekat Islam dried up. The mantle to uphold trade unionism was picked up by agents of the Third internationale, who assisted Semaun in founding the PVI. Now, Semaun's dramatic return has brought new issues that integrating with a political left that distrusts him."
POLITICS_WESTERLING_DESC:0 "Out of all the nations for Westerling to land in, Insulindia was his last choice, although he had adopted Islam at a young age, his relations with Sarekat Islam and leftism couldn't be worse. His unit in Insulindia was both famous and infamous for their discipline and lack of emotions in carrying out their tasks. In the utter chaos of strife that engulfed the nation. Westerling emerged as a very much foreign influence within the nation of many foreigners. That has given Westerling an sort of outsider edge that allowed him to crawl to the top of the heap."

He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."
POLITICS_FRANK_MACDERMOT_DESC:0 "Frank MacDermot is the youngest son of Hugh O'Rorke MacDermot, the Prince of Coolavin. He served in the Royal Army Service Corps during the Weltkrieg. Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A persistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapprochement with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser and formed the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."
POLITICS_GEAROID_O_CUINNEAGAIN_DESC:0 "Gearóid Ó Cuinneagáin is a radical Irish language scholar, born in Belfast to a middle-class Catholic family, he joined the Army Comrades Association and managed to work his way up to Minister for Justice of Ireland as a result of his charisma, leadership and radical ideas which attracted the interest of ACA leader Eoin O'Duffy. As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveler settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."

As a result of his anti-syndicalist views, he almost fell victim to an assassination attempt by the ICA in 1932, but managed to survive despite being badly wounded."

Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."

His breakaway party, Fianna Fáil, ultimately failed to be a success, becoming a minor party in the democratic opposition..."

During the War of Independence, he served in the IRA and was detained in the Curragh camp. He disagreed with the Anglo-Irish treaty and participated in the 1923 attempted uprising by the ICA, fleeing to the Commune of France after its failure, meeting with many French Jacobins while there and adopting some of their ideas. He later returned to Ireland to secretly continue agitating against the Irish government."

POLITICS_AZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Perhaps it was cruel fate that Saud bin Abdulaziz incurred the wrath of an Emir named Abdulaziz ibn Saud. Saud bin Abdulaziz was no stranger to strange and terrible events. The young Emir's crowning at age ten a machination of the Al Sabhan family, his maternal family. He witnessed as a young man the death of famous British Explorer William Shakespeare without ever realizing the humor in his name, or that his death would leave the Rashids with no allies during the Weltkrieg. Despite squabbling, the loss of the Rashid army to British maxim guns and a betrayal by his cousin, the Rashid family survived. A head on his shoulders allowed him to secure a protection deal with the Emir of Kuwait, the leader of the Howietat, and an unsteady peace with Nejd. Now this Emir is grown and ready to lead Arabia through the violence and betrayal towards a brighter future."
POLITICS_ABDULAZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "Born to a naïve Saud bin Abdulaziz aged only 20. Abdulaziz bin Saud did not know the harsh tent his father grew up in. when Abdulaziz's time came for military service, he chose instead to travel. On his personal pilgrimage on a horse with no name, he observed the changing world of warfare in Egypt and Constantinople. He returned to Ha'il not in a tawb, but in a fashionable black uniform ordered from Germany. Now that Saud bin Abdulaziz is dead, his son has determined to avenge his family and end the Saud feud once and for all."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "The only son of the late Faisal bin Hussein, Ghazi escaped the wrath of the Turks in Hejaz by hiding in El Esah with his cousin Zeid bin Hussein. In El Esah, Ghazi was cared for by the remaining forces of Lawrence's rebellion, but financial assistance from Britain dried up in 1926. This left Ghazi to seek protection from Ottoman soldiers with the Howietat. This led to a temporary truce between the Rashids and the Hashmites when the Howietat were admitted into Jabal Shammar. The influence of Ghazi's name is still strong, as well as the legacy of the Arab Revolt among Bedouins yearning for freedom. Thus, it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon receiving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' wellbeing. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_IRQ_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early successes paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in his speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal reputation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his reputation can save him from the machinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_IRQ_DESC:0 "Atban was the one-time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was successful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the Turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_IRQ_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along the 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."

POLITICS_BAKR_SIDIQI_DESC:0 "Unlike many Kurds that joined the Ottoman Army's special Hamidiye units, Bakr Sidqi joined the general army alongside Arabs in after training in Istanbul. This slot allowed him to gain allies within the Ottoman command throughout the Weltkrieg. After many divisions of the Ottoman 4th Army were discharged in 1921, Sidqi managed the welfare of both Arab and Kurd troops in Kirkuk. Sidqi cultivated a loyalty in his men towards him above official orders, which only increased when military pensions were cut in 1922. When the Assyrian rebelled in 1925, Bakr personally led his troops through towns killing soldiers and civilians alike. It was this ruthless efficiency and the recent desertion of the Hamidiye that gave Bakr an informal rule as military governor of the Mosul Vilyet. Bakr's aim is to subordinate the Kurdish tribes under his military clique with the help of Arab and Turkish soldiers."
POLITICS_BARZANJI_DESC:0 "Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî is the leader and patriarch of the Berzincî clan living to the north of Mosul. Although Mehmûd himself is Sunni, his ancestor Musa Kazem of the Twelver Shia gives him authority over Kurds in Ardelan. Mehmûd has spent the last decade gathering arms and supporters from Iranian Kurdistan for revolt. This revolt is planned the same way prior Kurdish revolts have, and the incredible success has bolstered Kurdish claims that their dynasty is as legitimate as the Qajars or Osman."
POLITICS_BABA_SHEIKH_DESC:0 "Nominally a citizen of Iran, Haji Bana Sheikh was a religious leader for the Mahabad province of Persia before the Weltkrieg. His position as a Sheikh only recognised by the Kurds in Mahabad, in which he was considered a moderate Shia leader. When the Russians entered Kurdistan, he formed the Alliance of Islam Committee to seek cooperation with Iran and Azerbaijan. Haji cultivated an ally in General Reza Khan, which has finally paid dividends in Persia's triumph. Haji collaborated with the exiled Mistefa Barzanî in 1932 to establish the PDK, although they soon clashed over whether the party would support Iran's claims or not. Haji's pro Iran position and Reza's support led to a breakdown of this coalition in 1935, though both leaders stay in touch."
POLITICS_MIHEMED_DESC:0 "It was only after the fall of the Soviet Union that Qazi Mihemed had realised his calling was socialism. Born into a rare Kurdish aristocracy and destined to be a poet, Qazi published his poems in Kurdi and Farsi, drawing the ire of the Qajars. His poems never reached the West, as the Khoyboun refused to publish his work. When internationalism finally came to Kurdistan, his works were found in the hands of socialists and he was found and uplifted from a jail in Sanandaj to realise the Kurdish destiny. Unlike most Levantine socialists, he rallies the Kurds in a united faith in Allah instead of nationality."
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "A relative of the Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî, Mistefa was only five when his family was imprisoned by the Ottoman military. Spending the majority of the Weltkrieg in hiding with his remaining family, Mistefa first became involved in his brother Ehmedê's milita in the 1920's. Ehmedê's militia attempted to steal arms from the Ottoman 4th Army in 1925, leading to Ehmedê's capture and execution. Mistefa fled with the remainder to Azerbaijan, where he joined Haji in establishing the PDK. Mistefa was disturbed to find the Haji had allies in the Persian military, and lobbied for the party to turn away from secularism and cooperation with Iran towards total autonomy and Barzanî tribal laws. Officially Mistefa and his allies are the leaders of the PDK."
POLITICS_SHEIKH_SAID_DESC:0 "Follwoing the end of the Ottoman Caliphate during the War in the Sands, many Kurds formerly belonging to the Hamidiye were discharged without pay. Those soldiers returned to find the Sidqi clique had slandered them as traitors. The Hamidiye moved into the Turkish side of Kurdistan, among the Zaza Kurds and Alevi. Among them was the Azadi Sheikh Said, an adept soldier who felt that the Ottomans were betrayed by secularists. His anti-secular position may have alienated the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds, but the Zazas rallied around him. Said reorganised the Hamidiye along with even Turkish volunteers into a fighting force to restore the Caliphate. Said himself was a Naqshbandi Sufi, who felt that Egypt had abandoned the path, and Salfis posed a threat to Sufi existence."
POLITICS_RIZA_DERSHIMI_DESC:0 "Karuman is a member of what had been a Ottoman loyalist family. The Bedirxans had ruled Bohtan for a century leading up to their independence activities. Compared to many other Kurdish nationalists, Kamuran had traveled to Britain prior to their revolution to establish a support group for Kurdish immigrants. His experience in Turkish law allowed him to arrange for people to leave Kurdistan for Britain until 1924. Following the revolution, Kamuran worked in the Commune of France developing new alphabet based on French to enable Kurds to spread their message internationally. This work was allowed despite his dealings with the former empires, until 1929 when his residency was revoked. This turned him against socialism, and his publications made out of Turkey reflected this. He is brought in as a competent economist and intellectual President of Kurdistan, in order to give dignity to the post."

POLITICS_AHMED_SHARIF_DESC:0 "The third-generation ruler of the Senussi Oder of Tripolitania, Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi inherited a precarious role from his father, Muhammad Idris. Compliance with the Ottoman Caliphate was never fully embraced by the many Sufis in Tripolitania. The Weltkrieg broke the Senussi solidarity, and Ahmed Sharif fell out of favour to his cousin Idris, who was declared Al Mahdi as Senussi during the crisis. Thanks to an army raised by Ottoman General Nuri Killigil, Ahmed Sharif was able to oust Idris and force him into exile in Egypt. Italy's dissolution provided the prextext to invade Fezzan, and thus Ahmed Sharif became the first King of Tripolitania under Ottoman protection. A newfound hostility has found Ahmed adrift from his former allies in Al Ahzar university in Cairo, with his subordinates slowly being replaced by Turkish yes men and foreign trained intellectuals."
POLITICS_RAMADAN_SEWEHELI_DESC:0 "A survivor of the Republic of Tripolitania, Ramadan was forgiven by the Senussi Order due to his popularity in Tripolitania and was able to get a minor post in government until today. Through international assistance, Ramadan has recreated the Republic to represent all Libyan people oppressed and divided. His policies towards modernisation has drawn a lot of critics, especially his decision to mandate Italian over French as the second language of Libya."
POLITICS_SHARIF_GARIANI_DESC:0 "Hailing from a pious Senussi family in Bayda, Sharif El Gariani served as a Senussi leader and took an orphan named Omar Mukhtar into his order after Omar's family had died. Sharif came to regret this in 1911 when the Italians came to Cyrenica. A pragmatist and a pacifist, Sharif yielded to the Italians. His ward Omar instigated the people of Bayda into resistance against the Italians and Sharif. Omar's loyalists left Sharif to tend to the casualties of war, these victims would later remember Sharif's dedication to survival, and elected him leader of the Republic. Sharif has renewed his dedication to the Libyan people, and lamented that Omar could have been a greater leader if he cooperated with the wider world."
POLITICS_HUSSEIN_MAZIQ_DESC:0 "Born at the tail end of the Italian occupation, Hussein Maziq was the son of a patriotic resistance fighter in Benghazi. Maziq's family submitted to the Senussi order when Idris reclaimed the land from the Italians, and were put in touch with the legendary commander Omar Mukhtar. Maziq covertly supported Idris in exile, and simultaneously educated himself in Italian and French to work with industrialists. When the Second Weltkrieg came to Tripolitania, his organisation helped people evacuate to Algiers. Now this reputation has become known, and the grateful people of Libya have elected him President."
POLITICS_ABU_MENIAR_DESC:0 "Among the Qadhadhfa, very few would have expected an illiterate Bedouin to rise in the alien ideology of socialism. But when the Italians were occupying Qasr Abu Hadi, the illiterate Abu Meniar bought schoolbooks in Italian. His journey towards literacy in Italian continued after their army retreated, and his fascination with changes happening in Europe led him to move his family to Tripoli in 1923. Tripoli being the center for Italian expats, Abu Meniar began reading Il Popolo d'Italia. Mussolinis strive for the unity of Italian people to overcome poverty led Meinar to ingratiate himself with the right people. Upon the rightful succession of the Internationale, Abu Meinar became their most trusted associate."

Škirpa and a number of minor disgruntled officers formed the Iron Wolf Organisation, a National Populist paramilitary fighting against German rule and the Slavic minorities within the Kingdom, as well as the Party of Lithuanian Interests as the movement's political arm.

Even though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, it's unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him. And Karl Gero is as much of a foreigner to them. It's hard to say if Mindaugas III would survive even a day on the throne without the Kaiser backing him from the shadows."
POLITICS_KAZIMIERAS_II_DESC:0 "A Polish-Lithuanian aristocrat from Kretinga, Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, now Kazimieras II, has committed the greatest sin possible in the eyes of the common Lithuanian - selling out to the Russians and giving up his nation's sovereignty to return the country under the hated eastern tyrant. This event has tainted his image to his people forever, and even though Tiškevičius is a capable administrator, a bright mind and even feels some compassion for the people he rules, his rule over Lithuania is tenuous at best."

A committed nationalist, he advocated the national self-determination of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg; with the establishment of the German led Lithuanian puppet government following the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Voldemaras returned to his homeland to again fight for its independence. As head of state, Voldemaras is likely to pursue an ultra-nationalist agenda which promotes the superiority of the Lithuanian people and devotion to the state."

Following the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro between the 'Liberal' revolutionaries and the United States, he emerged as a guerrilla leader fighting within the north of Nicaragua. Him and his regiment of 400 men killed many, but were forced to retreat south and fight on with Sandino. While Sandino was in Mexico, he bravely fought in in the south against the United States occupation until Sandino returned, and became one of the leaders in the push northward and the eventual liberation of Managua. Once the revolution ended, he ended up forming his own party known as the 'Partido Campesino de Nicaragua', focused on rights for the lower class and improving the education system. While also learning how to read starting in 1932(Something he still struggles with), he is an adored individual among many of the Nicaraguan lower class."
POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC:0 "Juan Bautista Sacasa was Vice-President of former president Carlos José Solórzano until he was overthrown in a coup by former president Emiliano Chamorro Vargas.

However, after the signing of the Pact of Espino Negro, he stepped down as president due to his disliking of United States influence and went back to exile in Mexico. Serving mainly as an observer in Sandino's revolution, he decided to return to Nicaragua around the same time as Sandino and was present for the liberation of Managua. With him and Sandino finding themselves agreeing on basic principles, Sacasa was able to form his own party known as the 'Partido de la Revolución Liberal'. Mainly supported by those who prefer traditional democracy compared to Socialist and the small higher class, he has surprisingly managed to gain a decent base of support and some dedicated followers of his cause."

Initially supported by the United States in his first presidency and helping to negotiate a treaty that allowed the United States to build a canal through Nicaragua. His presidency was largely looked over besides succeeding to pay off a significannot portion of Nicaragua's debts. However, despite his efforts, he failed to win the presidency in 1923. Following the 1926 election of Carlos José Solórzano, he couped the government, setting off the chain of events that led to Sandino's government. For this, some credit him as the beginning of the revolution while others discredit him as power hungry. All that matters now however is that his dream of returning to the presidency has finally come true."
POLITICS_ADOLFO_DIAZ_DESC:0 "Adolfo Díaz has been one of the main targets of a smear campaign from Sandino, and for not entirely wrong reasons. Helping put down liberal president José Santos Zelaya in 1910, he was sworn in as president with much help from the United States. Leading the presidency first from 1911-1917, he was the definition of an American puppet furthering the goals of American companies like the Tonopah Mining Company. In 1914, he suffered a liberal revolt which one part in many long years of the 30 year long US military occupation, with marines being forced to suppress the revolt. These marines stayed in Nicaragua for over a decade to keep order while also giving the US permission to build a Nicaraguan canal. However, after Chamarro's coup in 1926, the 2nd Marine occupation force swore him in as president. His attempts to suppress unrest failed, and he was forced to concede for new president José María Moncada. Ever since he lived in the US, until now. A foreign force has occupied the country, and he is once again needed to suppress the unrest that plagues the region."

Upon returning to Jerusalem, he saw that the Husayni family's aim for an independant Palestine was based on a conflicting promises and antisemitism. Although he himself was Muslim, he believed that the prevailing Palestinian nationalism would be hijacked by a foreign power. Thus, Raghib established his own branch of the Watani party in Jerusalem to counter this movement and the Husayni ambition."
POLITICS_AWNI_DESC:0 "A member of the Al Fatat since before the Great War, Awni assisted in the relief efforts in the Jordan Valley during the Officers Revolt of 1918.

Now Awni finds himself in control of a vastly unprepared nation that barely knew of his work in the struggle for independence."
POLITICS_MUSA_AL_ALAMI_DESC:0 "Musa Al Alami was the son of the Mayor of Jerusalem, Faidi al-Alami. His upbringing in Jerusalem where Jewish and Muslim converge geve him an appreciation for a government that expedites trade and promotes economic prosperity. The waning power of the Ottomans made his continued allegiance to them impractical to these goals, so in 1926 Musa established Al-tanmiat to prepare cooperation with Zionist groups. Non-aggression agreements were honoured, and subsequent votes propelled Musa into office."
POLITICS_MUFTI_DESC:0 "The son of Jerusalem's mufti and a mortal enemy of the Nashashibi clan, Amin was always quick to deal. The Husayni family's ongoing anti-Zionist position was on the decline until Abraham Antebi was arrested by the Turks. Then sentiment began to turn in Amin's favour. Through deal making in Syria, Amin was able to provide homes for survivors of the 1918 Officers Revolt. The return of Antebi proved to be another boon, as the Yildirim that accompanied Antebi began a campaign to destroy all political dissident in Palestine. Arabs in Palestine flocked to Amin, and he continued to make deals on their behalf all the way into office."
POLITICS_ANTEBI_DESC:0 "Albert Antebi spent the first 40 years of his life trying to mediate the Muslim Jewish divide in the Jerusalem Vilyet. When the Jewish Colonisation Association told him to buy land in Jerusalem for Jewish settlements, he always paid the Arab landowners a fair price. His goal of a peaceful creation of Israel was destroyed when he joined Mustafa Kemal in the Caucasus. After nearly dying in an Istanbul prison, Antebi was released as a bargaining chip of the Yildirm Army Group. He was given the ceremonial title of General Governor of Palestine, the first Jew to be honoured by the Ottomans in centuries, and held in Turkish custody as a virtual prisoner."
POLITICS_HILUPAL_DESC:0 "Radwan became General Secretary of the Palestine Arab Workers Society after the Third Internationale voted for and funded it's reestablishment. Before this, the PAWS was in severe danger of bankruptcy in Jerusalem, as the Yildirim had seized their assets following the return of Antebi.

Thus, he avoided most of the turmoil of the civil war and the danger that the Papacy underwent in its later stages. He was the first pope since the unification of Italy to give an ascension speech at Saint Peter's, as the practice has been abandoned during the 'Hostage Years' under the Savoyard monarchy. His papacy has been also marked by increasing tensions between factions in the Curia, and the troubled re-establishment of temporal authority."

POLITICS_VILLARAN_DESC:0 "Manuel Vicente Villarán Godoy was born in 1873 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated with a PhD in jurisprudence in 1895 from the 'Universidad San Marcos'. He became a teacher in that same university and would return to his educative role many times during his political career. He was named Minster of Justice, Cult and Instruction during President Leguía's first regime, and would become an active member of Peruvian politics until Leguia's coup in 1919. He was chosen as Principal for the San Marcos University, but rejected his position in protest of Leguia's takeover, and began writing three Manifestos, all of them praising the youthful fighting spirit of his students and warning of the danger that entailed having a Caudillo leading Perú. He was exiled in 1925, but would return in 1927, trying to stay away from politics. During Sanchez Cerro's government, he took part in the subsequent constitutional reforms, although he didn't defend some points that the new constitution brought up. Now that he's president of Perú, he'll take a pragmatic approach to the issues Perú faces, trying to compromise with the UR and focusing on investing in better services and education for the nation."
POLITICS_JOSE_DE_LA_RIVA_DESC:0 "Jose de la Riva Agüero y Osma was born in 1885 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The grandson of the first Peruvian president, José de la Riva Agüero y Sanchez-Boquete, he graduated from the 'Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature, philosophy and law, and managed to get a PhD in jurisprudence in 1911. His first political move was to write an article criticizing Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\nThat travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. With Cerro's death, he became his legal successor in the UR, although Benavides took over the real power upon his death. Now that Agüero is in power, he'll try to take Perú in a radical new direction and return the old glory of the Virreynato back to Perú"

He graduated as bachelor in literature and jurisprudence in 1913 and in Political Science and Administration in 1914. In 1930 he became the Mayor of Lima, but resigned a year later after discrepancies regarding the autonomy of the city's Instruction ministry, and his differences regarding Benavides's Autocratic rule. He left to Ecuador in a self-imposed exile after death-threats towards his family from radical UR members, only to return after Benavides gave signs of wanting to restore democracy to Perú, where the contacts he had gained him a place in the Partido Socialdemocrata. Now that he's President of Perú, he'll do his best to bring peacefully a welfare-system into Perú, trying to compromise with the APRA and the other democratic parties wherever possible."
POLITICS_UGARTECHE_DESC:0 "Jorge Prado Ugarteche was born was born in 1887 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. Son of Mariano Ignacio Prado, who was President of Perú twice in his life, Jorge studied in Law in the 'Universidad de San Marcos' from 1904 to 1909, and then joined the military academy after graduating, becoming lieutenant by 1914. He joined with his brothers to the Partido Civil in 1914, where they helped in the coup d’état that overthrew President Billinghurst. He would later become deputy for the Dos de Mayo province, but would be exiled with his brothers for opposing Leguia's regime.\n\nAfter the assassination of Sanchez Cerro, Benavides, who was a childhood friend of Jorge, recalled him from exile in order to help him in his rule. Jorge began a reform to free political prisoners and recall political exiles that were punished by Sanchez Cerro and Leguia's regimes. However, Ugarteche would be forced to resign due to internal pressure, and Jose de la Riva Agüero would take his place, reinstating the hardline policies against detractors of the regime. Disillusioned with Benavides regime, he formed the Movimiento Democratico with the support of his brothers. Now that Jorge has managed to become President, his belief in the free-market and pro-entente leanings will surely lead to a liberalisation of the Peruvian economy, ushering in a new era of economic prosperity to the nation."

Factionalism has begun to crack the once unified UR, with many within it vying for power, most notably Luis Alberto Flores Medina, General Ureta Montehermoso and Carlos Miró-Quesada.

He signed up for 'Facultad de Letras de la Universidad de Trujillo' when he finished high-school, but would later decide to study to become a Lawyer in the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in Lima. There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\nHe would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-Americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the burgois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\nNow that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_CHURATA_DESC:0 "Gamaliel Churata, whose real name is Arturo Pablo Peralta Miranda, was born in 1897 in Puno, Perú. Churata formed several culturalist groups in his youth, through which he met Manuel González Prada, Raul Haya de la Torre, and most importantly, José Carlos Mariategui, who would become a close friend of Churata. He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution. Now that Churata leads Perú, he'll focus on restoring the Andinean cultural identity and purge the Spanish-descendant bourgeoisie from the government, bringing about a new culture and society for the now new country of Piruw."
POLITICS_GONZALEA_PRADA_DESC:0 "Julio Alfredo González de Prada y Verneuil was born in 1891 in Paris, France. The son of known Peruvian anarchist Manuel González Prada, he'd graduate from the 'Universidad San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature in 1910, and would later graduate as a bachelor in Jurisprudence, later achieving a PhD on said career. In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in its more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to suppress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú. A staunch believer of Anarchism, now that Prada is in power, he will focus on bringing about his father's vision for a descentralized and free Perú."

His diplomatic ways with other members and professional handling of propaganda for the party made him quickly rise through the ranks, becoming one of the possible successors to Agüero. Now that Miró-Quesada is in power, he's bound to continue the status-quo Agüero created and keep working forward for Agüero's vision of a glorious Hispanic Perú."
POLITICS_FLORES_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto Flores Medina was born in 1899 in the small town of Ayabaca, Perú. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in the late 1910's. He staunchly opposed the government of Augusto B. Leguía, for Flores would be imprisoned. He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\nFlores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly. However, his rejection of all races outside of the Spanish-descendant Criollos is bound to shine through in his policies, and might upset the local native and Asian population..."

He graduated as an artillery second lieutenant from the Escuela Militar de Chorrillos in 1913. After beginning studies in the Escuela Superior de Guerra, he'd be sent to Italy and France to perfect his ability as an artillery officer. A decorated officer, he joined the UR due to his ultra-conservative views and admiration for Agüero, even if they both had their differences.

He continued perfecting his military ability throughout his career, taking an important role in the war against Ecuador, but he never truly prepared to be a politician. As such, now that he's in power, he'll seek to restore the Peruvian democracy, but not before restoring stability to the country and enacting laws to prevent future Caudillismo. However, his rejection of the native population may cause trouble with the large Quechua-speaking minorities in the country...."
POLITICS_BUSTIOS_DESC:0 "Reynaldo Chukiwanka Ayulo Choquehuanca, better known by his regnal name, Pachacutec II, was born in 1914 in Lampa, Puno Province, Perú. The son of Francisco Chukiwanka Ayulo and considered one of the descendants of the Incan emperor, Huayna Capac, he has taken advantage of his father's popularity to rally the Indians to his cause. His father graduated as a lawyer in 1908 from the 'Universidad de Arequipa' and would go to Puno, Perú, where he began fighting for better rights for natives and created an alphabet in which natives could write Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, helping the native population to improve its literacy rates as these languages conflicted with the latin alphabet. Reynaldo became involved in French émigré circles and was influenced by the writings of Charles Maurras. Seeing the government mistreating the native populations, Reynaldo took over his father's institutions and began going from village to village rallying the natives for an insurrection to finally be free of the Criollo oppression."

With the growing unrest in the island as Nationalist groups like the PNPR continued to undermine American authority, Winship was appointed as Governor of the island in 1934. Unlike his predecessor, Winship has taken a more hardline stance towards the forces trying to destabilize Puerto Rico, militarizing the Insular Police force to face off any threat to American power. However, Winship has also criticized the American Government for not investing in the island, which had been harshly struck by the Great Depression, and that has gained him some much needed local support to stay in power"

Born in the Stockholm working-class neighbourhood of Södermalm, Flyg has been active in the Swedish radical left since a young age. In 1917, he split off from the SAP with Zeth Höglund and Karl Kilbom to form the Swedish Communist Party, a brief experiment that soon failed when the Russian revolution was crushed. Nonetheless, the young Flyg would prove to be a force to be reckoned within the Swedish left.\n\nIn more recent years, Flyg distanced himself from his less radical comrades and took on the doctrine of total commitment to the Revolution propagated by the Sorelians in the Commune of France and Oswald Mosley in the Union of Britain, though adding his own unique values to it as well: Flyg is known to oppose notions of an indigenous socialist revolution in America and, ironic to his previous positions, Russia, believing that the revolution has to originate in Europe as it would otherwise take the shape of anti-European imperialism, noting on the side that neither Russia nor America harbours an orthodox totalist movement."

After living half of his life abroad in the west, Antoun returned to his homeland in 1925 to find the dream of democratic Lebanon dead. In Lebanons's rubble, Antoun founded an organisation called Natural Syria, dedicated to a non-sectarian independent Syria that could stand against Ottoman and Western Imperialism. Sharing only a distaste for imperialism, Antoun rejected the message of the syndicalists as divisive and rejected the Ba'ath ideals. Antoun sees Natural Syria as the homeland of ally Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis and Lebanese regardless of race. In his writing, Antoun claims that he will merge the best parts of socialism, nationalism, and patriotism under the Zawbaa."

Where many heard the call of Faisal's Arab Revolt, Fawzi heard only the commendations from General Otto von Kreiss. When the Turks were victorious, they made Fawzi a Pasha. Although showered with praise, Fawzi refused to call himself a Pasha. His current role as military governor is unique among the vilayets as he exerts considerable control over the soldiers in his command."
POLITICS_ADIB_BIN_HASSAN_SYR_DESC:0 "Sami Al Hinawi has spent his career avoiding the easy paths to power. Never renouncing his Arab name in the Ottoman Military, his loyalty earned him the right to use his birth name. The allure of the Arab Revolt never reached him in during his time in the Jerusalem Vilyet. A possible alliance between his officers and the emerging SSNP was rejected on the same basis that the easy way to power is a trap. Time will tell whether this stalwart commitment will pay off."
POLITICS_SHUKRI_QUWATILI_DESC:0 "Among the several branches of Al Fatat in the Arab world, none would be as successful as Syria's. This is due to the careful manoeuvring of their leader, Shukri al-Quwatli.

Shukri's position in Syria is an intermediary between the liberal burghers and conservative landowners that hold judicial power in Syria."
POLITICS_SULTAN_ATRASH_DESC:0 "Sultan Atrash is relied upon by the Syrian people not because he is a great unifier.

POLITICS_NAZIK_AL_ABID_DESC:0 "Once exiled to Cairo in the wake of a Turkish crackdown, Nazik al Abid has pulled off an incredible achievement other Arab feminists like Tarab Abdul Hadi could only dream of; for she was elected head of state of Syria. Her work establishing the International Red Crescent and her liberal position towards veils has finally paid in dividends for her and for women across Syria, as her notoriety has put her in a prime position to lobby for their rights in the country."

Where many of this contemporaries joined secret societies and stocked weapons, Al Asali knew that legislation would lead to Syria's freedom. When the pen signed Syria's independence, he was in Cairo in Hal'il meeting with heads of state. It is through the outside in that Sabri al-Asali assumed power in Syria. He may be out of touch with the common Syrian, but his commitment to economic ties with the Arab world set Sabri apart from his peers."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A Sheikh is not the first person the International expected when they asked Syria to elect their first leader among the syndicates. While it is true that Muhammad al-Ashmar's first station was a Mufti, he is now a leader of the people. His influence within the mosques in reinterpreting Islamic law and rejecting Secular syndicalism in favour of voluntary Zakat from all sets him apart from any other branch of socialism in Syria."
POLITICS_MICHEAL_AFLAQ_DESC:0 "Michel Aflaq was in Paris during the Syndicalist revolution. Swept up in the socialist organisations, he joined the Commune's government as an informal student. There he studied trade unionism with Saladin al Bitar, and they both decided that Syria was ready for revolution in 1925. The revolution to be, a renaissance or Ba'ath, never materialised. Michel was unable to form trade unions in Damascus or Mosul, so he returned to Paris in 1930 abandoning the Ba'ath party. His return as of late as an emancipator and the forced creation of a trade union council in Damascus means his power is backed up by his superiors in the Internationale more than it is backed by Syrian supporters. This will not stop Aflaq from realizing the dream of Ba'ath however, a united Syrian proletariat."

Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after 6 years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many work to mantain, the matter of the constant syndicalist threat, especially towards His Holiness in Rome, and his lack of a male heir, weigh heavily on him. The creeping feeling of powerlessness, even now as he is a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "작가이자 노동조합 지도자, 상원 의원, 언론인, 그리고 생디칼리스트. 존 '잭' 리드를 나타내는 단어는 이처럼 많습니다. 전임자인 알렉산더 버크먼이 사망한 후, 이 열정적인 급진사회주의자는 미국의 생디칼리즘 운동을 주도했으며, 그 단체를 큰 성공으로 이끌었습니다. 언론인에서 대통령으로 가는 이 긴 길에서 그는 많은 적이 생겼지만, 많은 동맹이 생기기도 했습니다. 그는 프랑스 코뮌을 창건한 세바스티앙 포르의 미국 버전이 되어 카리스마 넘치고 통합된 생디칼리즘 선동가로 이 나라를 완벽하게 만들기로 결심했습니다."
POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "친구들에 의해 '선인장 잭'으로 알려진 존 낸스 가너 4세는 텍사스 출신의 변호사이며 하원 의원으로 오랫동안 지냈던 미국의 새 대통령입니다. 그는 민주당 지지자이며, 약간 보수적인 정치인입니다. 그리고 가장 중요한 것은 그가 민주주의의 열렬한 지지자라는 것입니다. 이 텍사스 출신 판사는 좌파나 우파와 타협할 이유는 없다고 생각합니다."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "전 미국 상무부 장관이자 현재 미국의 대통령인 허버트 후버는 미국 역사상 가장 미움받는 사람 중 한 사람으로서 그 자리를 굳혔습니다. 첫 임기 동안 대공황을 더 심각하게 만들기만 했던 것에도 불구하고, 1932년 하원을 통해 재선된 것은 광범위한 분노를 불러일으켰습니다. 대통령에게 있어서 슬픈 현실입니다. - 경제를 회복시키려는 그의 모든 시도는 실패했고, 상황을 진정시키려는 노력은 상황을 더 악화시킬 뿐이며, 그의 당마저 그를 외면하고 있습니다."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "외국 정부들과 자신의 국민들에게 미움받는, 미합중국의 첫번째 독재자인 총사령관 맥아더는 약하지 않습니다. 급진주의 국가들을 제거하기 위해 미국 지배층의 부름을 받아서 온 이 장군은 국가를 자신의 연대를 지휘하듯이 다스립니다 - 질서와 엄격한 규율 그리고 그에게 반대하는 모두에 대한 강력한 처벌을 통해서 말입니다. 그는 자신이 진정으로 미합중국을 구하기 위해 이곳에 왔다고 믿고 있지만, 건국의 아버지들은 그의 행동을 지지할까요?"
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "루이지애나 주지사인 휴이 롱이 정확히 어떤 사람인지 말하기는 어렵습니다. 일부 사람들은 그의 '재산 공유' 계획이 새로운 옷을 입은 생디칼리즘이라고 말하는 반면, 다른 이들은 그의 비민주적, 족벌주의적 정치 방식과 경쟁자를 제거하기 위해 준군사단체 '미닛맨'을 이용하는 것이 그의 국민대중주의적 자세의 신호라고 지적합니다. 어찌됐건, 롱 대통령은 서민들의 사랑을 받고 있으며, 때로는 오만하게 보일 수도 있지만 그의 카리스마는 이례적이며 남부에서의 입지는 과소평가될 수 없습니다."
POLITICS_FLOYD_OLSON_DESC:0 "깡촌 출신임에도 불구하고 플로이드 올슨은 전국일주와 매사에 적극적인 태도를 통해 미국의 폭넒은 다양성을 통찰할 수 있었습니다. 유대인 조력자, 세계산업노동자연맹 소속의의 항만 노동자, 그리고 변호사라는 경력은 올슨을 1920년대에 진보주의에 심취하게 만들었습니다. 올슨은 1924년 선거 이후 로버트 라폴레트의 진보당에 합류했습니다. 올슨은 진보당의 동맹을 확보하기 위해 1930년에 위궤양 치료를 받을 때를 제외하고 무려 10년 동안 쉬지않고 일했습니다. 급진주의에 반대하고자 하는 초당적인 표심이 이 대단히 영향력 있는 미네소타 주지사이자 평화 옹호자에게 쏠렸고 결국 그를 백악관에 입성시켰습니다."
POLITICS_QUENTIN_ROOSEVELT_DESC:0 "The youngest son of former president Theodore Roosevelt, Quentin's early life was groomed for political activism in his father's Republican Party. Quentin, however, wished to be a pilot, and was injured in his training in 1918. Seeing his family being torn by Archibald Roosevelt's entry into Huey Long's camp, Quentin pushed into politics and served as New York's Senator during fateful 1936. Now that the great national disaster is over, Quentin's plan to follow in his father's footsteps and push for a new American Fair Deal."
POLITICS_ALF_LANDON_DESC:0 "알프 랜던은 정치에 입문하기 훨씬 전부터 석유사업에서 성공한 기업가였습니다. 이 자수성가 기업가는 그가 오늘날까지 애착을 유지하고 있는 스탠다드 오일회사와 관련된 로비 단체인 미국석유가스협회를 설립했습니다. 당초 선거 11시간 전에 후버의 자유방임주의적 입장과 결별하기로 한 랜던의 결정은 선거날 당일에는 공화당과 그에게 상황이 유리하게 돌아가도록 만들었습니다. 결국 후버조차도 마지못해 랜던을 지지하게 되었습니다. 이제 자신의 겸손한 태도에도 불구하고 랜던은 미국이 원했던 경제 회복에 대한 부드러운 열망의 표출구임이 선거를 통해 증명되었습니다. 그러나 석유 로비와의 강한 유대는 그를 사회주의자와 롱 지지자 양쪽의 적으로 만들고 있습니다."
POLITICS_WENDELL_WILLKIE_DESC:0 "웬델 윌키는 대통령이 되기 전부터 많은 구설수에 올랐습니다. 원래 그는 윌리엄 제닝스 계열의 딕시크랫(남부 민주당 보수파-탈당파)이였지만, 대학에 입학하고 나서는 사회주의자가 되었습니다. 1933년에 중국을 방문했을 때는 윌키가 송미령(쑹메이링)과 불륜을 저질렀다는 소문이 끊이지 않았습니다. 작가인 이리타 반 도렌과의 불륜은 말할 것도 없습니다. 대공황이 닥쳤을 때 민주당이 은행의 강제 휴무를 강요하는 조치를 반대함으로써 윌키는 존재감을 얻게 되었습니다. 금융기관에 정부의 간섭이 시장경쟁을 저해하도록 만들지 말아야 한다는 윌키의 주장은 그가 대통령으로 당선되도록 만들었습니다. 이 다재다능한 사람이 막중한 역할을 지닌 대통령직을 잘 수행할 수 있을지는 두고봐야 합니다."
POLITICS_HARRY_BYRD_DESC:0 "많은 남부 대중주의자들이 휴이 롱의 매력에 빠져 민주당을 탈당했던 반면, 해리 F 버드는 그의 입장을 고수했습니다. 해리 버드는 미국 독립전쟁에 참여했던 버지니아 상류층 가정 출신입니다. 국가 부채를 줄이기 위한 분리정책과 재정적으로 보수적인 정책을 단호하게 내세우는 사람. 반 케인즈 정책을 고수하는 해리 버드는 미국의 전통적 정치가라는 안정적 이미지로서 선거에서 승리했습니다."
POLITICS_PHILIP_FOLLETTE_DESC:0 "A professional Wisconsin progressive, Philip is the most successful of the politically active La Follette family. A friend and former mentor to Floyd Olson, who had been convinced to join the Farmer Labor Party in order to continue to help his state in need. With the spectre of isolationism that Philip's father Robert stood for, Philip nonetheless stands behind the need for a strong military in the Americas as well as the full extent and strength of the government as promoted by the Farmer Labor Party."
POLITICS_HENRY_WALLLACE_DESC:0 "아이오와의 찢어지게 가난한 농부라는 사회적 위치는 결코 헨리 월리스가 어린 나이에 세상을 보고 통찰력을 얻는 것을 단념시키지 못했습니다. 월리스는 주요 혁신인 하이브레드 옥수수 품종을 발명하여 막대한 부를 얻었고, 그렇게 얻은 재산으로 월리스는 세계 일주를 하게 됩니다. 헨리는 인도를 방문했고 그곳에서 당시 러시아에서 인기 있던 기독교 무정부주의와 사회주의의 요소를 이끌어냈던 힌두교 사상인 신지학(견신론)을 알게 되었습니다. 이러한 사상은 결국 월리스를 주류 사회주의로부터 멀어지게 했고 그는 미국으로 돌아와서는 농민노동당에 입당했습니다. 월리스는 그 누구보다도 실용적인 경제학자이자 미국에 절실히 필요한 농업개혁을 시행할 수 있는 농업전문가입니다."
POLITICS_JAMES_MURRAY_DESC:0 "A great controversy surrounded the election of James E. Murray during his election campaign. Tabloids and Republicans all came at Murray claiming that he cannot run for President due to being born in Canada. The truth of these statements may never be known, but his life prior to attending NYU is shrouded in mystery. His life began in earnest when Murray won the Governorship of Montana in 1933. His term as a Democrat was marked by an unusually cooperate relationship with unions and his bold belief that economic reform must disrupt a market if the market is failing."
POLITICS_ALBEN_BARKLEY_DESC:0 "Alben draws from over thirty years of political experience within the Democrat party and his own smart judgement. While Alben supported Wilson's reforms, he opposed McAdoo's attempts to reverse those policies. After several failed national election bids and a steady voting record, Alben was the right piece on the chess board in this election to gain the White House for the Democrats."
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "The final ascent into the White House by Richard Russell Jr. is the final stroke in a long game that extends even before his time in the Democrat party. Russell Jr. has accumulated the right combination of titles in the US Navy, in the Georgian House of Representatives, and the US Congress to secure universal respect. His focus that de-segregation should happen entirely on southern terms proved popular with a national audience. Time will tell whether this position is sustainable."
POLITICS_GLEN_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Being President was just as much a surprise to Glen Taylor as it was to the voting public. The man that had wanted at one point to be a wandering preacher and then a country singer had finally reached a position that befitted his skills. Taylor was known in Congress as a compassionate economist and advocate of progressive policies and singing to children on the steps of the Capitol. Taylor's compassion fuled his opposition to segregation, and despite his eccentricities he has endeared himself to the American people, which is all he ever wanted."
POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC:0 "듀이는 출생지인 미시간 주가 아닌 뉴욕에서 성공한 타고난 지도자이자 정치인입니다. 듀이는 1930년대의 유럽, 아시아, 아메리카에서 전쟁이 날 것을 예측하는 것을 포함하여 그의 주장이 옳았음을 지속적으로 증명해 왔습니다. 뉴딜정책이 전적으로 공화당에 덕분이 아니라는 그의 주장 또한 옳았습니다. 듀이는 '연민어린 자본주의'라는 구호로 유세를 벌였고 그의 개혁이 무조건적인 복지로 이어지지는 않는다고 주장했습니다. 마침내 자신이 선거에서 이길 것이라는 듀이의 대담한 예언이 실현되었습니다."
POLITICS_EARL_WARREN_DESC:0 "Young Earl Warren thought his career was doomed when his father Mathias was blacklisted for joining a strike, but instead it motivated the young man into excelling past this stigma. This prior stigma motivated Earl into joining numerous fraternities and lodges in order to intermingle with the people that stigmatized his father, as well as serving in the military. These connections paid off and sent Earl into a life of public service and eventually reached the Governor seat of California in 1932, where he steered the declining Progressive movement towards the political center away from the even more declining West Coast Socialist Party. Earl became a progressive entryist within the Republican party, pushing for national desegregation."
POLITICS_CHARLES_MCNARY_DESC:0 "Charles McNary stood behind the foundation of the Republican party when it was under attack from all angles in 1936. A Progressive at heart but also a pragmatist, McNary was seen within the party as an insurance against the Northwest descending into radicalism, which also made him allies with an ally of Entente interests in North America. In fact, his company provided electricity to a significannot portion of Western Canada by the 1940s due to this relationship."
POLITICS_HARRY_TRUMAN_DESC:0 "세계대전 당시 미국이 그들의 중립과 고립주의 정책을 연장하기로 결정한 그 순간, 해리 트루먼이 대학 졸업장과 법학 학위를 포기하면서까지 준비했던 전장에서의 영광이라는 꿈은 좌절되고 말았습니다. 중앙아메리카에서 오랫동안 복무한 그는 현지에서 직접 경험한 게릴라 전술의 위력을 몸소 깨달았습니다. 트루먼은 이때 습득한 대게릴라 전술을 혼란스러운 미주리 주에 가져왔고, 1936년 혼란으로 피해를 입은 도시들을 구제하려는 상원을 도왔습니다. 이 공로를 인정받아 민주당 내에서 급격히 영향력을 쌓은, 이제 명백히 정치인이 된 트루먼은 뉴딜 정책의 지지자이기도 했습니다. 여기서 가장 주목할 만한 것은 그가 보수주의자들을 상대로 한 군 내부의 인종차별 철폐 운동을 공개적으로 지지한 것이었습니다."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Coming from a prominent business family with ties to international trade, William Harriman was able to establish several successful businesses in New York and became an important player in interstate trade. As the federal government has jurisdiction over those transactions, Harriman joined the Department of Commerce. A tactical minded approach to foreign policy and the goal of promoting America's ideology against the radicals that threatened her abroad resonated with Americans and pushed his career upwards."
POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "The decision by Strom to turn the Conservative Manifesto into a raison d’état for the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party was a risky move. Strom had spent decades within the Democratic Party attempting to oppose the overreaching powers of the Federal Government, and ensuring that the party never officially endorse desegregation. This gamble has now paid off as Strom Thurmond has been elected President."
POLITICS_HAPPY_CHANDLER_DESC:0 "The turning point in Happy Chandler's career came during his intermission in politics to become the Commissioner of Baseball. A term as Governor had established Chandler as a respectable and industrious Democrat with a firm hand on the party line. This stint as Commissioner of Baseball saw a historical decision to allow integrated baseball teams, which led to the end of segregated baseball. This only further elevated Chandler as a Senator and made his decision to carry this support into the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party even more important. His insistence that fiscal conservatism and the race question were not tied together stood against Strom Thurmond's line..."
POLITICS_JOHN_BRICKER_DESC:0 "An advocate for limited executive power and a non-interventionist interpretation, John Bricker is as old fashioned a Republican as they come. Bricker's career prior to his presidency was that of a rabble raiser and dissenter within the Republican Party railing against suspected socialist sympathizers and opposing the use of executive power to push economic reform. The country as a whole having come close to populist or authoritarian dictatorships just a few years prior."
POLITICS_HAROLD_STASSEN_DESC:0 "While the senior Republican Party leadership like Willkie and Dewey had preoccupied the 1930s with the minutia of the 1936 crisis, Harold Stassen was serving in the US Navy and being exposed into the wider world. An important lesson learned is the importance of international cooperation as opposed to the tariffs that his fellow Republicans were pushing for. A firm opponent of international syndicalism, Stassen believes that laissez faire economic policies must be replaced by strategic economic cooperation There is no need to hold onto undemocratic institutions such as segregation which only feeds syndicalist arguments."
POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "1915년, 유망한 사관생도 아이젠하워가 중앙아메리카에서 새로운 군사 교리를 시험하려 했었던 들끓는 열정은, 사관학교 동기인 현지 장군들이 형편없는 수준의 반란군을 이겨내는데 실패하면서 사라졌습니다. 사관학교 동기인 다른 현지 장군들은 독재와 급진주의에 대한 충동에 빠졌습니다. 아이젠하워는 연방정부와 각을 세워 민간정치의 영역에서 벗어나려고도 했습니다. 아이젠하워는 정치인이란 '대학 출신 왕의 똥개'라고 생각해서 정치인이 되기 싫어했습니다. 그러나 아이젠하워가 이런 생각을 가진지 약 4년 후, 그는 대통령 자리에서 취임선서를 하고 있습니다. 아이젠하워가 감독하던 군 내 인종차별 철폐에 대한 국가적 합의가 이런 상황을 만들어 냈습니다."
POLITICS_ADLAI_STEVENSON_DESC:0 "The reputation of Adlai Stevenson's father, that of an isolationist, dogged Adlai Stevenson II well into his political career. This position among the Democrats was put to the test with the American First Party, which depleted the party rank. Adlai stood to his roots during this most contentious time and persevered. As Governor of Illinois Adlai reformed the police force to be less at odds with socialists and even defended their rights to organize in the face of the Red Scare. Most doubted Adlai's ability to win against the respected General Eisenhower, but through an in kind appreciation from socialist voters Adlai won in the end."
POLITICS_JOHN_SPARKMAN_DESC:0 "Born in a log cabin and raised on a farm, John Sparkman had a very relatable upbringing. A rapidly ascending legal career and political clubs later and Sparkman had become the Democratic Representative for Huntsville. His victory being especially important in the fateful Year of 36 as he beat the AFP's candidate. Sparkman was instrumental in opening education up to immigrants and women in the South. Silent on social matters and bolstered by his support of science education, Sparkman spoke out against defensive US foreign policy, and eventually left for the Constitution Party, where his reputation put him on the fast track to presidency."
#Actually James Eastland not Harry Cain
POLITICS_HARRY_CAIN_DESC:0 "Son of the Mississippi Delta District Attorney, James Eastland was sidetracked from politics for the first three decades in order to run a plantation. An advocate of sharecropping who profited from their work until his plantation quadrupled in size. Eastland stood up in the Senatorial race against the Klan's candidate, and won. Against the Conservative Coalition, Eastman supported the Fair Deal legislation in his home state while voting for it in Congress. As his reputation and passage into the Constitution Party carried much weight, he successfully lead many Democratic voters to his campaign as the closest thing the party could offer to a national candidate."
POLITICS_CULBERT_OLSON_DESC:0 "Culbert Olson had faced both the stigma of running as a Mormon politician, and running as an atheist in his lifetime. In California as Governor, Culbert had to deal with long standing rumors that Mormons had a blood feud with the US Government. Olson's superb term as Governor in passing health care legislation and allowing non-SPA socialists to organize. By the time of the national race, Culbert had come out as an atheist, and faced a second uphill battle. The party stood by him, and ultimately his portfolio allowed him to reach the White House."
POLITICS_EMMETT_ANDERSON_DESC:0 "Hailing from Tacoma, Washington, Emmett T. Anderson was a successful printmaker before politics. During the Crisis of 36, Emmett ensured that presses for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer got out during the strike in Seattle. Emmett also ran his own pamphlets during the crisis decrying the Seattle Democrats as allies of the Silver Legion, and pressed to a peaceful end to the strike. After this the Republican Party got wind, and Emmett was elected to Congress. Eventually his actions were taken up on a national level by Republicans, and became a rallying cry against Democrats that made the difference during the election."
POLITICS_JOHN_GELLATLY_DESC:0 "오리건 주 벤턴 카운티에서 파산한 이후, 존 아서 겔라틀리는 책임감 있는 재정 보수주의자로서 자신을 표현해왔습니다. 1918년 워싱턴 주의 상원의원으로 선출된 이후, 겔라틀리는 1920-30년대에 걸쳐 여러 차례 주지사로 출마했고, 마침내 36년의 위기 동안 부주지사 자격으로 주지사직을 계승했습니다. 태평양 합중국의 건국자들은 신뢰할 수 있고 문제의 소지가 없는 공화당 후보자를 필요로 했고, 겔라틀리는 그 조건에 부합하는 사람이었습니다."
POLITICS_HOWARD_HUGES_DESC:0 "Son of an All-American family of ministers and inventors, Howard Hughes broke out of the Midwest by demonstrating a knack for engineering. After the tragic death of his parents, young Howard was thrust into a family fortune and a medical facility in Maryland. Using this vast fortune, Howard created the Summa Tool Corporation, a maker of fine industrial tools. The proceeds were funneled into Howard's Hollywood scripts, including the Academy Award winner 'The World Is Yours'. Expanding finally into Republican politics in California, Howard stood out among a crowd of old money. From RKO to a line of passenger aircraft, Howard was elected under the promise to finish Boulder Dam in Colorado and electrify the states."
POLITICS_FRANK_MERRIAM_DESC:0 "남북전쟁 참전용사의 아들인 프랭크 메리엄은 아이오와에서 태어났고 중서부 지방에서 인생의 계획대로 법조 경력을 쌓아갔습니다. 캘리포니아에서의 공화당의 급부상을 보자마자 프랭크는 자신의 직업을 서부쪽으로 옮기기로 마음먹었습니다. 메리엄은 캘리포니아에서 사회당과 롱아일랜드인의 파업을 물리쳐냈고, 심지어 우프톤 싱클레어가 주지사 후보로 지명되었을 때 반격까지 했습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 전통적으로 공화당 언론들은 메리엄의 세금 개혁에 반대했습니다. 맥아더가 권력의 정점에 오르자, 대부분의 공화당 언론들은 최고 경영자 허스트에 의해 모든 공화당원들을 비난하라는 주문을 받았습니다. 메리엄은 허스트와 맥아더에 대한 대중들의 항의의 표시를 통해 행정부 수반의 자리를 확보할 수 있었습니다."
POLITICS_FLETCHER_BOWRON_DESC:0 "A California native and veteran of the Nicaragua War, Fletcher Bowron has a unique relationship with Latin Americans among Republican politicians. The first mayor of Los Angeles to support Cinco De Mayo parades, and an advocate of imprisoning radicals on suspicion. This coupled with Bowron's pursuit of organized crime impressed hardline republicans enough to put him in a greater office."
POLITICS_ROBERT_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Robert Taylor Jones began as a civil engineer out of Tennessee. The most significannot project Jones was on was the Panama Canal. The boom of civil constructions out west drew Jones into Arizona, where he entered Democratic politics on a constructive platform. Serving as Governor of Arizona during the Crisis of 36, Jones countered the SPA and AFP candidates who sought to push the state into rebellion. Sadly, rebellion was forced upon the state when MacArthur came, and several democratic politicians betrayed the republic for autocracy. Thankfully Jones had contact with the true loyal Democratic Party, and campaigned for national office."
POLITICS_CLARENCE_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Clarence Martin came into prominence during a consequential Washington State election of 1932, which unseated many Republicans from state office. Clarence may have come in during a major shift, but his credentials in Washington included fostering small business and his unusually respectful discourse. Clarence on principle refused to exaggerate or appeal to populist tendencies in his election campaign, and distinguished himself in the Washington Senate by sponsoring necessary civil works projects. As the Democratic Party was able to wrest the civil works initiative from Republicans across the West, Clarence reaped the benefits politically and received more votes in 36 than Garner in Washington. The desertion of some Democrats to MacArthur only made Clarence's loyalty stand out, and his nomination to the executive chair that more likely."
POLITICS_OSWALD_WEST_DESC:0 "West was luck that the provisional government set up after MacArthur's rise did not specify natural born Americans, as he was born in Canada. Starting out as a Land Agent for Oregon, Oswald West was always diligent with his work. As Governor, West saw passage of Women's Suffrage, Worker Rights, and even state Prohibition, all strengthening the Democratic Party in the state. Taking the initiative to finance a State highway System without Federal money, West successfully pushed public projects. A more fervent advocate of conservative democratic laws on alcohol and even authorizing sterilization as punishment for breaking morality codes."
POLITICS_CHARLES_SPRAGUE_DESC:0 "A newspaper magnate and business owner, Sprauge got his start in Oregon politics as a newspaper commentator. Reprinted nationally and famed for his advocacy of small business, internationalization, and fiscal conservatism, many expected him to enter into Democratic politics. Sprauge instead ran as a Republican, and successfully capture democrat voters who supported a fiscally conservative but active Fair Deal. A surprising number of SPA also voted him into Governorship, as he supported their employment programs. This position he encouraged within the Republican Party, and eventually allowed him to gain support throughout the West."
POLITICS_RALPH_CARR_DESC:0 "A follower of Hoover's Republican Party, Ralph Carr's politics in Colorado were fiscally conservative and socially mixed. While Carr did deploy the National Guard to end the Green Mountain Dam Strike of 36, within the PSA Carr refused to imprison radicals. Going so far as to pardon several AFL labor leaders that were arrested without charges. Ultimately a Constitutionalist in a time of crisis where others were stretching legal boundaries. Carr was able to use this as leverage within the Republican Party to secure nomination and ultimately the election."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_LEE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lee was one of the first hard right Utahan Republicans, being elected only shorty after Mormons were allowed into Congress. While others resisted the draft on religious grounds, Lee joined the military and eventually fell on hard times after veterans’ pensions dried up. Running for Governor as a Republican and promising to promote Veteran Pay, Lee had also become acquainted with the old boys’ network of politics. This old boy’s network almost led to his dismissal after he was caught in an illegal gambling den by pro-AFP sheriff W. Skousen. Lee continued to advocate for fiscal conservatism and for admission of all religious right groups into Republican circles, which eventually got him nominated for the highest office."
POLITICS_MONRAD_WALLGREN_DESC:0 "Wallgren's career prior to politics was a combination of business management and pool sharking. A personable and approachable attitude helped jump-start his political career in Washington, especially during the close election of 36. The State Senate saw Wallgren's take an active role in national security, and advocate restricting press of radical elements, Wallgren stood firm as formerly Democratic papers were blacklisted along with SPA and AFP ones after they began supporting MacArthur. Wallgren's opposition eventually forced him out of the Democratic Party while in office, to which he responded by joining the up-and-coming Progressives."
POLITICS_CLYDE_TINGLEY_DESC:0 "Clyde Tingly came to New Mexico to heal his wife's TB, which was worsening in the Ohio weather. Tingly became incensed at the Republican rule in New Mexico, and so began a career in politics and advocacy for health-care reform. A supporter of early Fair Deal proposals, Tingly flew into office on the promise that a new governorship would allow for better usage of state funds. Albuquerque began recovering from the Great Depression under tingly even as most of the nation fell further, and his dedication to health care legislation pushed him into national politics where he became a Progressive."
POLITICS_ARTHUR_LANGLIE_DESC:0 "After a decade on the Seattle City Council. and another four years in the State Senate, Arthur Langlie was one of the youngest nationally recognized politicians in Washington history. Running against and losing to Monrad Wallgren, Langlie recouped and ultimately ingratiated himself into the Republican Party enough to win the nomination. Seen by many as a common man and exemplifier of the immigrant spirit, Langlie answers the Progressive claims to represent immigrant rights."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MCKAY_DESC:0 "Beginning work before he was out of High School, McKay thought his apex would be a used car dealership in Salem, Oregon. Instead, the Republican party encouraged him to run for local and then state offices, eventually being elected to the State Senate in 36. This climactic year saw McKay willingly leave his old supporters behind for the Progressives. An advocate for the national highway system, fiscally moderate Fair Deal policies, and a support for public works has moderated some of the Progressives more radical elements, and helped them take liberal Republican voting districts."
POLITICS_DANIEL_THORNTON_DESC:0 "Active in the 4-H and agrarian rights program, Daniel Thornton moved to Colorado from Texas in order to run a cattle ranch. A brief career in the State Senate combined with his strong personality made his campaign as a Republican to Governorship fairly easy. Known for his Stetson hat, cowboy boots, and smoking pipe, many reports have called Thornton the 'Republican Garner'. The media seemed to place him at odds with Richard Nixon during the election, but their mutual understanding to allow the elder politician to run made the difference at the end."
POLITICS_BOURKE_HICKENLOOPER_DESC:0 "Coming to the West after MacArthur's coup, Bourke initially had very little public support within the provisional government. Partnered with J. William Fullbright, Bourke helped the Republicans whip into shape, and pushed for an isolationist policy towards Canada and Japan. Seen by many as a patriot of a country on the brink of dissolution, Bourke won office by assuring a hard stand against all traitors to the American Republic."
POLITICS_VICTOR_MEYERS_DESC:0 "A multi-talented if not disparate man, Victor Meyers has been called the 'Pagliacci of Politics' in his early days. Back when his political career competed with his musical career. Insisting that the Democrats oppose Prohibition in Washington, he rode aboard a beer wagon during his Gubernatorial campaign. After this failed he began mixing Progressive policies with his natural talent to draw attention to himself. Promising tribes across the West voting rights, advocating pensions, child welfare and unemployment pay, Meyers was at times taken seriously and other times laughed at. A unique proposal for building single-pour concrete housing to solve the homeless issue proved to be both eccentric and effective. Ultimately the Progressives and the American people took him seriously enough to elect him into office."
POLITICS_ANDREW_HOCKENHULL_DESC:0 "A quiet and unassuming politician, Hockenhull rose through the ranks of New Mexican politics through his strong adherence to the Democratic Party line. So, his switch to the Progressive Party in 1928 was a pragmatic switch. Although he did not win the Governorship in 1936, Hockenhull persisted in the public service until the Progressives were forced to run him."
POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "A native Californian and an obstinate quaker, Nixon attempted to join the FBI after college. After failing to do so, Nixon became a lawyer for the major oil companies of California. Nixon began a feud with fellow Republican Earl Warren, which persisted into the national political scene. Nixon took jobs prosecuting politicians in the Pacific States who were suspected of radicalism, and had a good winning record against socialists. Finally Nixon defeated Warren within the Republicans by promising him the Governorship of California in exchange for the National Nomination."
POLITICS_GEORGE_CRAIG_DESC:0 "Born in Brazil, Indiana, and trained to be a lawyer, George Craig was classmates with his eventual electoral rival, William Jenner. Craig would eventually compete with Jenner for the Republican Party nomination after his service during the Crisis of 36.

As Governor of Indiana, Craig reformed the state government, and refused funds for the national highway in favour of local contractors."
POLITICS_VAL_PETERSON_DESC:0 "A school administrator in Nebraska for the first twenty years of his career, Peterson's introduction into politics came when he entered the US Air Force, and was assigned to trained with Hugh Butler. Butler eventually recommended him to Nebraska Governor Dwight Griswold. Peterson succeeded Griswold as Governor, and worked his way up the Republican Party power structure. Eisenhower recognized a fellow soldier and elevated Peterson within the Party, where he became a nationally recognized politician and presidential candidate."
POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "A life filled with difficulty prior to his ascent into office, John Winant's fortunes turned often. From dropping out of Princeton due to inability to pay, to the US Air Service. His military rank had distinguished himself enough to be elected Governor of New Hampshire, while also losing his remaining fortune in the Great Depression. Made Ambassador to Canada, Winant became torn between his duty and an affair with MP Churchill's daughter Sarah. This relationship was broken off, and ultimately his contacts in Canada made his election to the Liberals surer. The chaos of 36 continues to press upon Winant's mind however."
POLITICS_HERBERT_LEHMAN_DESC:0 "As of his inauguration, Herbert Lehman is the first Jewish Head of State in American History. Born into the storied Lehman family, and served in the US Army general staff, Lehman got his start supporting Al Smith's presidential campaign. Lehman served the rest of FDR's term after his death in 1921, and subsequent terms as Governor. Lehman opposed the conservative wing of the Democrats and opposed Eastland while addressing Congress. The Crisis of 36 forced Lehman out of NYC and into the provisional capital of Boston, where his shrewd dealings allowed him to secure safe passage of refugees into New England from the CSA."
POLITICS_PERCIVAL_BAXTER_DESC:0 "메인 주의 공화주의의 수호자였던 퍼시벌 벡스터는 수십 년 동안 주 내의 급진주의에 반대해 왔습니다. 벡스터 상원의원의 임기동안 메인 주에 있는 국립공원은 대규모로 확장되었고 대공황 동안 성공적으로 자유의 땅을 유지시켰습니다. 1936년에 벡스터는 KKK 회원들을 폭로한 후 몇몇 공화당원들을 탈당시켰습니다. 맥아더의 등장은 벡스터로 하여금 새로운 뉴잉글랜드 정치에 뛰어들게 만들었고, 이곳에서 그는 정상적인 비-급진적 민주주의 정치로의 회귀를 대표합니다."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_KENNEDY_DESC:0 "보스턴의 아일랜드계 가톨릭 집안에서 태어난 케네디는 태어날 때부터 정치 엘리트는 아니었습니다. 조셉 케네디는 태어날 때부터 가능한 한 높은 명성을 얻기 위해 하버드에 입학했습니다. 장녀의 난장 수술과 같은 가족 문제는 가문의 건축과 사업 성장에 의해 관심 밖으로 밀려났습니다. 케네디는 미국에서 가장 큰 위스키 수입 회사를 소유하고 있었고, 안타깝게도 대공황 때 그렇게 모은 이윤을 사업에 재투자하게 되었습니다. 36년의 위기와 뉴잉글랜드의 탄생으로 케네디는 미국 역사상 최초의 가톨릭을 믿는 국가원수가 되면서 민주당 유권자들을 자기 편으로 끌어들였습니다."
POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_HERTER_DESC:0 "Born in Paris, and moving to Boston at a young age, Herter came into wealth via marriage to the Pratt family. Sent to the German Embassy, Herter would frequently recommend America intervene in the Weltkreig to no avail. His return saw him becoming Governor of Massachusetts, and the establishment of essential diplomatic ties with Canada that came into play in 37. Herter continues to advocate America's entry into the Entente, the liberation of democratic France, and the final justice of dismantling the German Empire. "
POLITICS_JOSEPH_MARTIN_DESC:0 "조 마틴 주니어는 북동부 지역에서 가장 큰 영향력을 가진 공화당 지도층입니다. 보스턴 이브닝 크로니클지의 편집자였던 마틴은 주 상원의원으로 선출되게 됩니다. 마틴은 민주당의 게리맨더링 시도에 맞서 싸웠고, 결국 1936년에 공화당 전국위원회에 참여하게 됩니다. 미국이 붕괴될 바로 그 때, 마틴은 리드와 롱은 물론 찬탈자 맥아더에도 반대하는 보수 공화당원들을 규합했습니다. 이로 인해 그는 뉴잉글랜드 민주당을 누르고 선거에서 승리할 수 있었습니다."
POLITICS_DENNIS_ROBERTS_DESC:0 "A quiet but integral member to the Democratic establishment, his cooperation with the Canadian Liberal party saw his rise through a Canadian sponsored election campaign. This campaign emphasized his loyalty to Rhode Island, his Naval service, and his voting record in favour of civil rights."
POLITICS_PETER_GERRY_DESC:0 "A protégé' of MP Lyon Mackenzie King, great grandson of VP Elbridge Gerry, and inheritor to a vast fortune, Gerry already had a leg up in politics. Becoming the Democratic Whip in the 1920s while a Senator for Rhode Island, Gerry worked his way up the political and social ladder. Marrying into and gaining the support of the Vanderbilt family helped Garry finance bailouts for Rhode Island businesses. MP King convinced Gerry to join the Liberals in 1940 in order to advance their common interest in social liberalism, which eventually paid off in his presidential campaign."
POLITICS_SHERMAN_ADAMS_DESC:0 "A career that spans Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and ultimately the executive chair. Serving as the Republican Speaker of the House in 1940, Sherman pushed through Old Age Pensions laws and worked towards a balanced budget Fair Deal road-map. This ultimately proved popular with Americans after decades of indecisive economic policy, and was used heavily in Sherman's presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ROBERT_BRADFORD_DESC:0 "A Republican in a strongly Democratic Massachusetts, Bradford's combination of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism helped make the case for his term as Governor in 1938. There Bradford successfully prevented strikes from going violent and used public funds to build homes to solve the housing issue. Bradford chaired a Silent Guest program during the turmoil of 36, asking Americans to donate the cost of a meal to the public relief for refugees from Macarthur. This charitable attitude continues into his term in the executive office."
POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Tobin's career nearly ended when he was indicted for malpractice that caused the Coconut Grove fire of 1938. Tobin was charged with refusing to allow a club to be closed in order for safety measures to be installed. Tobin learned from this tragic mistake and became a rare Democratic supporter of unions. The union vote helped elevate Tobin within the Democratic Party, where he protected organization rights, and worked this into a reconciliation position during his national campaign."
POLITICS_PAUL_DEVER_DESC:0 "As a lawyer, Dever made a career in Boston defending business practices of corporations. This all changed when Dever enlisted in the US Army, and served alongside mixed race divisions. As he found out that most of these soldiers were in the Liberal party, Dever entered into politics under the Liberals. An uphill battle against Democrats in Massachusetts commenced that saw Dever promise veteran benefits and welfare extension."
POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Aiken, the stalwart Republican and advocate of state-controlled Fair Deal legislation. Aiken in the State Congress passed laws to protect debtors during the Great Depression from losing their all-in debt collection. As Governor, Aiken instituted a pay-as-you go system for road maintenance that worked better than Fair Deal highways in New Hampshire. As a result, Aiken was chosen to run for the party nomination against conservative Republicans."
POLITICS_THOMAS_HART_DESC:0 "An admiral during the inter-war period, Hart had built a reputation of personal bravery and the ability to maneuver among politicians stateside. maneuvering helped by his marriage of his daughter into the Wilson political family. Ultimately Hart decided to run in national elections as a Democrat, appealing to the impoverished voting base of his native Connecticut."
POLITICS_CHARLES_POLETTI_DESC:0 "Unlike some of his more privileged Republican counterparts at Harvard, Democrat Charles Poletti was not born into one of the leading WASP families of the Northeast. The son of Italian immigrants, Poletti attended college on a scholarship, waiting tables to pay for textbooks. Quickly moving up the ranks of the Democratic party, Polletti's rustic charm enamored him with working-class voters across the country. Now President, Poletti has an ambitious reform agenda of racial integration, expanding welfare, and an aggressive anti-syndicalist international stance. Whether his domestic reforms will earn the support of his more conservative counterparts remains to be seen, however."
POLITICS_NELSON_ROCKEFELLER_DESC:0 "While some pundits are saying the name 'Rockefeller' alone catapulted Nelson to the presidency, Rockefeller's ascendancy to the highest office in the land was no given. Ivy League-educated, and initially working mainly in the business world, the radicalism among other Republican candidates encouraged Nelson to run for the presidency as a check on his more extreme counterparts. Using his family network to seize control of the nomination, Rockefeller's progressive approaches to health-care, welfare, and the economy may be the key to helping unite a divided country."
POLITICS_HENRY_LODGE_JR_DESC:0 "Born into a prominent political dynasty with roots in both New Jersey and Massachusetts, it was no surprise that Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. decided to enter national politics. With a strong family network to rely on, he quickly built a strong power base among the powerful WASP families of the Northeast, catapulting him to the Republican nomination, and now the presidency. More moderate and diplomatic than other Republican candidates, it remains to be seen which direction he will take America in internationally..."
POLITICS_OWEN_BREWSTER_DESC:0 "Hailing from the quiet forests of Maine, Owen Brewster has emerged as a national leader in the anti-syndicalist movement. While initially supporting Huey Long and the AFP in the early 1930's, Long's rejection of the Klan, close allies of Brewster, led to him rejoin the Republican party. Brewster is infamous in Maine, and across the country, for his open courting of the Klan, who were influential in his early gubernatorial and Senate victories. Now President of a divided America, it remains to be seen whether he can reconcile his divisive past with a new view for the future..."
POLITICS_STYLES_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Formerly a teacher, Styles Bridges became the youngest governor in America when he emerged victorious in the 1932 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. Bridges then entered the Senate, earning a name as a ruthless anti-Syndicalist, not above using blackmail, treachery, and deceit to achieve his goals. In one of the most infamous incidents of the early 1930s, launched a major slander campaign in an attempt to label a leading SPA Senator as a 'rampant and notorious homosexual' and a 'traitor to the moral values of our nation'. This sensationalist attack earned him the enmity of Reed and the SPA, but enamored him with those opposed to Syndicalism. Now President, Bridges can turn his attention to stopping Syndicalism around the globe."
POLITICS_HIRAM_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "Born in the mid-century in Sacremento, California, Hiram Johnson came from a political family. Hiram's father, Grove Johnson, was a disgraced state representative, his mother was heavily involved in the Daughters of the American Revolution. Hiram's early political career was boosted by this legacy, and he became a competent DA for San Francisco in 1902. Hiram's gubernatorial race in 1910 was funded by the liberal Republican group 'the Lincoln-Roosevelt League' Johnson's campaign ran in opposition to the Southern Pacific Railroad corporation, who sought to lobby within the Republicans against Hiram. As Governor, Hiram supported anti immigration bills, and paved the way for a later Congressional career. The Republican estabilshment in California was rocked in 1932, when Hiram threw in his support for Herbert Hoover. Hiram's personal distaste for the Eastern Establishment meant he stayed away from the political chaos of 1936."

When the war was over, he formed the 'Centro Obrero Socialista' which would start the process of creating the 'Partido Socialista de Uruguay' in 1910, with Frugoni as its general secretary. He became deputy for that party in 1916 and 1920, however, with the fall of Britain and France to syndicalism, many of his party became to radicalize, turning his party into the 'Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay', whose advocation of violence forced Frugoni to leave the party he created, and has since then been rebuilding the Uruguayan Socialist Party.\n\nIn his words, 'Socialism is not violence, nor dispossession, nor redistribution', and now that he is in power, he shall respect the Uruguayan constitution and political system while at the same time trying to peacefully lead it to the revolutionary ideals he champions."

POLITICS_JOSEPH_LAGROSILLIERE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lagrosillière was born in Martinique on the 2nd of November, 1872. A very active French politician, Lagrosillière founded the Socialist Federation of Martinique (a branch of the SFIO on the island), and its newspaper Le Prolétaire.\n\nLagrosillière broke with the Parisian socialists in 1913, however, as they did not support the assimilation of colonies. Lagrosillière is a strong proponent of turning colonies into Departments, and the Federation of Martinique, without Lagrosillière, fell apart. It was revived in 1924 as the Second Federation. However, Lagrosillière continued his socialist advocacy in the Caribbean, continuing to become a politician in the West Indies Federation after the Weltkrieg.\n\nIn 1919, he made an electoral alliance with Fernand Clerc, a Béké industrialist on the island, which alienated him from his old socialist allies that criticized his 'alliance with capitalists'. He was arrested in 1925 for inciting trouble and violence, and again in 1931 for influence peddling.\n\nNow, Lagrosillière leads the PA and the West Indies into a new era of social democracy."
POLITICS_AIME_CESAIRE_DESC:0 "Born in 1913 on the island of Martinique, Aimé was from an early age greatly inspired by his grandfather Fernand Césaire who had been the first black teacher in the French colony who passed down a great deal of literary and scholarly aptitude to his grandson. After working his way through high school, Aimé Césaire journeyed to the Commune of France in 1931, disgusted with the colonial system of the West Indies and seeking to pursue the kind of higher education he had been unable to attain on his home island. During his sojourn at the Sorbonne University, he joining with a cadre of other black students, eventually founding a newspaper dubbed "L'Étudiant Noir" which promoted anti imperialist ideals and railed against the exiled French Republic's treatment of their colonial subjects. Aimé also coined the term Négritude, a literary movement promoting a revitalisation of African and Caribbean culture, as well as condemned the irreparable damage caused by the "decadent, morally degenerated parasites" who had oppressed his people. Due to his increasing conflicts with fellow students and teachers in the Commune, which he attributed to racial tensions and prejudice, Aimé eventually chose to return back to the West Indies Federation, just in time to bear witness to the people of the Caribbean cast off their chains. Invigorated by the struggle for liberation, he directed his revolutionary zeal and anti colonial fury towards building up and impressive line of credentials, penning radical treatises and holding fiery speeches on what he desired and demanded the new socialist government must due for the victims of imperialism. It was no surprise that in time, Césaire took it upon himself to see this dreams made reality, in a few years managing to rise to the top of the new Federation's political sphere."

## Yemen ##
POLITICS_YAHYA_HAMID_DESC:0 "From 1934 onwards, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, he now seeks to establish control over the Yemeni hinterland, establish a modern standing army, and establishing clear rules for succession of hereditary governorships, all while keeping a close eye on the tumultuous political environment in Sana'a itself. With al-Hamid at the helm, Yemen moves into the modern age while maintaining its semi-feudal state of affairs."

POLITICS_SHABAB_AL-AMR_DESC:0 "Out of Ta'izz, the Numan family could be described as middle class. As a Sunni, Ahmad could not attain a proper education in Muslim science to advance in Yemen. This may have been due to rumors that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a program that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of reactionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad was allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclamation for Yemen was to ease change into a country badly divided."
