### Focus Tree ###

 SCA_Nordic_Constitution:0 "북유럽 헌법"
 SCA_Nordic_Constitution_desc:0 "With the creation of a unified Nordic state, it is paramount that a constitution shall be adopted that counts for all the memberstates of the federation, emphasizing the strength of the federal government."
 SCA_Nordic_Parliament:0 "북유럽 의회 지정"
 SCA_Nordic_Parliament_desc:0 "We should establish a designated Nordic parliament elected through proportional voting in the entire federation, thereby ensuring every Nordic citizen will have equal representation in the federal government in Gothenburg."
 SCA_Joint_Sessions_as_Legislative:0 "Use the Joint Sessions"
 SCA_Joint_Sessions_as_Legislative_desc:0 "The joint sessions have proved a great success earlier, emphasizing the existence and close cooperation of the Nordic countries. These joint sessions will function as the proper legislative branch of the Nordic government."
 SCA_Council_of_Kings:0 "국왕 이사회"
 SCA_Council_of_Kings_desc:0 "The monarchs of our memberstates ought to fulfill their role together on the federal level, establishing a council filled with monarchs who shall appoint the federal government."
 SCA_Every_King_a_Turn:0 "Every King a Turn"
 SCA_Every_King_a_Turn_desc:0 "A council as head of state is bound to result in bureaucratic problems and disagreements. Instead each monarch should rule for two years, and then revolve power to the monarch of the next country."
 SCA_Judicial_Autonomy:0 "사법 자치"
 SCA_Judicial_Autonomy_desc:0 "Each memberstate should retain its own judicial branch and these judicial branches sholuld retain their full autonomy. If a Dane were to judge a Swedish case this would be bound to create nationalist friction."
 SCA_Nordic_High_Council:0 "북유럽 최고이사회"
 SCA_Nordic_High_Council_desc:0 "While the local judiciaries ought to remain in place, the highest court of each country shall be replaced by a single Nordic High Council of Judges, which shall have the last word in the most controversial of cases."
 SCA_Federal_Judiciary:0 "연방 사법"
 SCA_Federal_Judiciary_desc:0 "We should merge the judicial branches of all memberstates into a single federal judiciary. This will promote equal lawgiving in the entire federation and thereby promote ever closer federation."
 SCA_Ratify_the_Constitution:0 "헌법 비준"
 SCA_Ratify_the_Constitution_desc:0 "With all of the most important questions out of the way, it is time to let representatives of the federal memberstates ratify the federal constitution, making our federation a little more real."
 SCA_The_First_Nordic_Elections:0 "첫 북유럽 선거"
 SCA_The_First_Nordic_Elections_desc:0 "With the constitution properly established, it is time for NTC, mostly made up of civil servants, to transfer power to an elected federal government. To this end, the first pan-Nordic elections will have to be organised."
 SCA_Socialdemocratic_Triumph:0 "사민주의 과반확보"
 SCA_Socialdemocratic_Triumph_desc:0 "The NSAP succesfully secured its place, and came victorious out of the Nordic elections. With them, a unified Nordic welfare state is looming, one that will be a shining example for the rest of the world to follow."
 SCA_Safety_Net:0 "Establish a Safety Net"
 SCA_Safety_Net_desc:0 "We should establish a safety net for those unfortunate enough to be unable to work. It is not fitting for a civilised nation such as ours to allow the people to starve to death, rather than to help them."
 SCA_Aid_the_Nordic_Worker:0 "북유럽 노동자 원조"
 SCA_Aid_the_Nordic_Worker_desc:0 "The federation has gained its hard-earned prosperity off the back of the Nordic working class. It is only fair to help them, doing something back for the great achievements they secured."
 SCA_Secure_Social_Rights_Federally:0 "Establish Fundamental Social Rights"
 SCA_Secure_Social_Rights_Federally_desc:0 "Several fundamental social rights hold significance. We should ensure that the Nordic government shall be bound to fulfill the social rights the Nordic people, and arguably the people of the rest of the world as well, deserve."
 SCA_Invest_in_Education:0 "교육 투자"
 SCA_Invest_in_Education_desc:0 "Educating the young is an investment into the future. By ensuring our educational system is qualitatively superior, we can raise more people into higher paying jobs and thus increase our prosperity to an even greater extend."
 SCA_Invest_in_Healthcare:0 "의료 개선"
 SCA_Invest_in_Healthcare_desc:0 "Good healthcare is vital: without it, people may well die unnecessary deaths. We should ensure that healthcare is qualitatively good and affordable to common man of our federation!"
 SCA_The_Nordic_Model:0 "노르딕 모델"
 SCA_The_Nordic_Model_desc:0 "As a result of our efforts, the Nordic welfare state has developed into a shining example for the world. A democratic utopia that cares for its citizens without the need of resorting to tyranny or violence."
 SCA_Victory_for_Liberalism:0 "자유 연정"
 SCA_Victory_for_Liberalism_desc:0 "The liberals have surged throughout Scandinavia and secured themselves the majority needed to form the federal government. Their influence in these early days of the federation will certainly be felt."
 SCA_Safeguard_National_Autonomy:0 "Safeguard National Autonomy"
 SCA_Safeguard_National_Autonomy_desc:0 "We should ensure that we don't fall for the temptation of unnecessary centralisation. Such actions would only harm the popularity of the federation and keep it from improving the lives of its citizens. Local autonomy is therefore paramount."
 SCA_Support_Nordic_Business:0 "북유럽 사업"
 SCA_Support_Nordic_Business_desc:0 "The countries of the north have a healthy private branch. We should encourage this entrepeneurship for the good of the memberstates and the federation as a whole."
 SCA_The_Nordic_Standard:0 "노르딕 스탠다드"
 SCA_The_Nordic_Standard_desc:0 "Our sound and down-to-earth approach has allowed to us to set a standard for other countries to try and emulate. A standard in controlling the government, if you will."
 SCA_Conservatism_Reigns:0 "보수-농민 연정"
 SCA_Conservatism_Reigns_desc:0 "The Conservative Party and the truly Scandinavian Agrarian League have formed an alliance on a conservative platform. In support of farmers and morality, the influence of this first federal coalition will not be insignificant."
 SCA_Expand_Federal_Infrastructure:0 "연방기반시설 확충"
 SCA_Expand_Federal_Infrastructure_desc:0 "Scandinavia is stretched land with few people. We should invest in the infrastructure to connect the Swedes to the Norwegians and the Danes to the Swedes. This will be paramount in creating a true Nordic identity."
 SCA_Strengthen_the_Nordic_Bank:0 "북유럽 은행 강화"
 SCA_Strengthen_the_Nordic_Bank_desc:0 "It is important for us to strengthen the Nordic central bank to ensure the security of our Nordic currency and to ensure that investors will view the federation as a safe bet for their investments."
 SCA_Subsidize_Nordic_Farms:0 "Subsidize Nordic Farms"
 SCA_Subsidize_Nordic_Farms_desc:0 "The Nordic farmers are what keeps this federation fed. It would only be right to support their work for this great federation by subsidising their activities, lowering their prices and giving them an edge over the competition."
 SCA_Solidify_Federal_Unity:0 "Solidify Federal Unity"
 SCA_Solidify_Federal_Unity_desc:0 "We should encourage the consolidation of the federal identity, ensuring that Nordic citizens shall view themselves as just that rather than as Danes, Norwegians and Swedes primarily."
 SCA_Support_Religious_Education:0 "Support Religious Education"
 SCA_Support_Religious_Education_desc:0 "Religion holds significance in our culture and religious schools exist. We should support this type of religious schooling as it can only further our educational efficiency."
 SCA_The_Nordic_Example:0 "The Nordic Example"
 SCA_The_Nordic_Example_desc:0 "Our moral and economic perfection is an example for all to see, the identity of the Nordic Federation is an enviable one, and this is thanks to our efforts to make it so."
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Armies:0 "Merge the National Armies"
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Armies_desc:0 "It is highly inefficient to maintain three separate armies for one federation, despite the close cooperation. We should merge them all into a single army with a single command structure."
 SCA_Jungs_Mobile_Warfare:0 "융의 기동전"
 SCA_Jungs_Mobile_Warfare_desc:0 "The Swedish general Helge Jung proposes we invest in the motorisation of the army. This will give us an advantage in maneuvering throughout the stretched lands of Scandinavia and in the battlefield."
 SCA_Nordic_Trucks:0 "군 기동화"
 SCA_Nordic_Trucks_desc:0 "We can make our army significantly more mobile by adopting trucks to move their equipment. Let us motorize our army for the good of the federation."
 SCA_Fleischers_Superior_Firepower:0 "플라이셔의 화력우세"
 SCA_Fleischers_Superior_Firepower_desc:0 "Norway's Carl Gustaf Fleischer suggests a heavy focus on artillery, allowing us to use these heavy weapons to avoid giving up too many Scandinavians (whose numbers are limited regardless) to inflict casualties upon our enemies."
 SCA_Modern_Equipment:0 "현대 장비"
 SCA_Modern_Equipment_desc:0 "Important to minimize our losses and to maximize our army's fighting capacity is to invest in modern equipment for our army. We cannot allow ourselves to fall behind in this area."
 SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries:0 "개별군대 유지"
 SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries_desc:0 "While purely from the perspective of efficiency, a single merged army is best, it will be significantly easier to motivate the people's of our federation to fight under their own flag under that of the federation, where they may be subject to language differences as well."
 SCA_Priors_Grand_Battleplan:0 "Prior's Grand Battleplan"
 SCA_Priors_Grand_Battleplan_desc:0 "Danish senior officer William Prior has given his own pitch in favour of a very plan-based doctrinal plan for the coming years. According to him, by planning out the next war, we shall win it."
 SCA_Supreme_High_Command:0 "The Supreme High Command"
 SCA_Supreme_High_Command_desc:0 "We should establish a single Supreme Nordic High Command that has the last say over the strategy and deployment of our troops. This will allow for a greater degree of cooperation between our army divisions."
 SCA_Nordic_Tank_Brigades:0 "Federal Tank Brigades"
 SCA_Nordic_Tank_Brigades_desc:0 "Panzer brigades are key to winning wars in the modern era. These large armoured vehicles with significant firepower are capable of breaking through defences in which infantry forces would have been mowed down. All in all, we should invest in their development."
 SCA_Artillery_Investment:0 "야포 투자"
 SCA_Artillery_Investment_desc:0 "Artillery is vital to cover and support our forces in the dirt. By investing additional resources in the production of more artillery we can secure the support of our army delivered by them and gain an advantage in battles."
 SCA_The_Joint_Exercise:0 "합동훈련"
 SCA_The_Joint_Exercise_desc:0 "We should let all Nordic soldiers participate in a single large exercise, to prevent the armies from rusting in inactivity as well as to teach them to work together as a single military force."
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Navies:0 "Merge the National Navies"
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Navies_desc:0 "Reality is that the navies of our memberstates are simply too small to be meaningful in the grand scale of things, but together the navies make for a decently-sized single navy. If we are to reap the benefits of this however, we are to merge these navies under a single command structure."
 SCA_Atlantic_Blue_Water:0 "Atlantic Focus: Blue Water Navy"
 SCA_Atlantic_Blue_Water_desc:0 "The primary aim of our navy is to give our federation influence on the grander theatre. A significant presence in the Atlantic is an objective towards reaching that goal. We should focus on making our navy ocean-worthy."
 SCA_Develop_Cruisers:0 "순양함 개발"
 SCA_Develop_Cruisers_desc:0 "If we are to secure a presence in the Atlantic west of Norway and Denmark, we should invest in extending our cruiser arsenal. Without them, we are bound to find ourselves unable to exert the power we are desiring."
 SCA_Modern_Battleships:0 "Focus on Modern Battleships"
 SCA_Modern_Battleships_desc:0 "No navy is complete without a series of battleships capable leading the navy against our foes, serving as the largest ships with the largest amount of firepower available."
 SCA_Baltic_Green_Water:0 "Baltic Focus: Green Water Navy"
 SCA_Baltic_Green_Water_desc:0 "While a hope of exerting our influence into the Atlantic, is hopeful, for the next couple of decades our focus should be on the Baltic sea. With all our navies combined, we can become a significant player in this body of water."
 SCA_Destroyer_Development:0 "구축함 개발"
 SCA_Destroyer_Development_desc:0 "We should develop destroyers. These relatively small naval vessels are crucial in defending our larger ships and convoys from the submarine dangers that remain significant to this day."
 SCA_Uboat_Tactics:0 "유보트 전술"
 SCA_Uboat_Tactics_desc:0 "The U-Boat made a significant dent in the British navy, especially in the earlier portion of the Weltkrieg. In addition, they are relatively cheap to produce. We should invest in this technology; it will win the next naval war."
 SCA_Nordic_Navy:0 "The Nordic Navy"
 SCA_Nordic_Navy_desc:0 "The Nordic Navy shall be known as a significant fighting force, one that is determined to defend our shores from any enemy with the intention of invading the islands, fjords and Baltic coasts of Scandinavia"
 SCA_Nordic_Air_Authority:0 "Establish the Nordic Aerial Authority"
  SCA_Nordic_Air_Authority_desc:0 "Before we can move towards merging the air forces of our memberstates, we should ensure that our civilian and military air authority is harmonised throughout the federation."
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Airforces:0 "Merge the National Air Forces"
 SCA_Merge_the_National_Airforces_desc:0 "Our regional air forces are not sufficient to defend the airspaces from a large power. However, if combined, the force grows exponentially and we will become a force in aerial warfare to be reckoned with."
 SCA_Invest_in_SAAB:0 "Invest in SAAB"
 SCA_Invest_in_SAAB_desc:0 "The Swedish company Svenska Aeroplan AB produces top of the line airplanes. By helping them expand throughout the federation we will secure ourselves a main plane supplier of high quality."
 SCA_Expand_the_Airfields:0 "공군기지 확장"
 SCA_Expand_the_Airfields_desc:0 "We should expand the airfields dotted throughout Scandinavia to support the larger amount of planes that will move through and operate from their runways as a result of the harmonisation of the air force."
 SCA_Bombs_from_Above:0 "하늘에서 떨어지는 폭탄"
 SCA_Bombs_from_Above_desc:0 "Nordic bombs shall be dreaded by the enemy, obliterating industrial zones, cities, countries... And then to think they were sent from a country with such a beautiful countryside. Distressing."
 SCA_The_Nordic_Airforce:0 "노르딕 공군"
 SCA_The_Nordic_Airforce_desc:0 "With the merge and expansion of our federal air force complete, enemies will think twice about messing with us. There is a significant chance that they might find themselves, in the air at least, at the disadvantage."
 SCA_Advance_the_Integration:0 "Advance the Integration"
 SCA_Advance_the_Integration_desc:0 "While we may have come a long way, we are not there yet. There are still divisions between the different countries in the federation, and it is our task to erase them and bring the federation ever closer."
 SCA_Expand_the_Belt_Ferry:0 "Expand the Belt Ferry"
 SCA_Expand_the_Belt_Ferry_desc:0 "We should expand the ferry connecting the Danish island and peninsula to mainland Scandinavia, allowing for more traffic and a greater amount of interaction between the two, harmonising the culture between the two."
 SCA_Scandinavian_Highway:0 "The Pan-Scandinavian Highway"
 SCA_Scandinavian_Highway_desc:0 "We should work on building a highway that connects the far reaches of our federation with eachother, increasing the amount of people interacting and mending cultural differences as a result. After all, if it is easy to go to Sweden, why stay only in Norway?"
 SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_Oresund:0 "Design an Oresund Bridge"
 SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_Oresund_desc:0 "The Oresund dividing Zealand in Denmark from Scania in Sweden is a broader body of water than ever bridged before, but if we are to finally take away the cultural differences between our nations it is paramount to build one. This will likely still take decades however."
 SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_the_Belt:0 "Design a Belt Bridge"
 SCA_Plan_a_Bridge_over_the_Belt_desc:0 "The other side of the coin is bridging the rest of the belt. While it all is part of our Danish memberstate making the cultural isolation a bit less intense comparatively, it would still be economically very beneficial to bridge the bodies of water. At current however, this too would still take decades."
 SCA_Stockholm_Berlin_by_Train:0 "Stockholm to Berlin by Train?"
 SCA_Stockholm_Berlin_by_Train_desc:0 "If the aforementioned bridges were constructed, this would allow us to connect Scandinavia to the train net of mainland Europe, without the need to go through Russia. It would be a massive boon, but even before the bridges become technically realistic we can establish a different system with the ferries."
 SCA_Federalize_Governmental_Services:0 "Federalize Governmental Services"
 SCA_Federalize_Governmental_Services_desc:0 "By putting governmental services in the hands of the federal government, we can harmonise the manner in which decisions about said services can be made, which will hopefully increase the willingness to work towards closer federation in the memberstates."
 SCA_Unified_Schooling_System:0 "Unify the Schooling System"
 SCA_Unified_Schooling_System_desc:0 "By unifying the differing schooling systems of our memberstates into a single system, we can increase interaction between schools from different states. Norwegians will then have an educational development that will be recognisable for Swedes, bringing about a greater similarity in the next generation."
 SCA_Mandatory_Language_Classes:0 "Mandatory Language Classes"
 SCA_Mandatory_Language_Classes_desc:0 "The difference - be they sometimes subtle - between the Nordic languages can result in nasty communication errors. By ensuring that the schools in the federation teach all the major federal languages, we can go this problem out of the way and make a cultural unification ever more possible."
 SCA_Federal_Exchange_Programs:0 "Federal Exchange Programs"
 SCA_Federal_Exchange_Programs_desc:0 "By enabling exchanges from students throughout the federation, we will support cross-memberstate border friendships and cooperation, ensuring the growth of a solidarity between the youths of the Nordic nations."
 SCA_Nationalism_fades_away:0 "Nationalism Fades Away!"
 SCA_Nationalism_fades_away_desc:0 "Our efforts at expanding the interactions of the Nordic people in cultural and economic sense is paying off; while some will of course always remain stalwart nationalists, at least the amount of people identifying as Nordic citizen rather than say a Swedish citizen is lower than ever."

While they decided to go for the name of 'Nordic Social Democratic Workers Party', this sobriquet was enthusiastically adopted by the younger socialists, although the leader of the Danish youth wing, Hans Hedtoft, did clarify that the Nordic Social Democratic Party does not endorse syndicalism in any way.

This alliance includes the Norwegian Høyre party as well as both the Danish Venstre party and the Danish DKF party, which has left experts predicting that Denmark will be the main base of this party, even if it will still be a hotly contested region considering the strong presence of the social democrats. In Sweden, the traditional conservatives have joined this party, although some among them look with a certain suspicion to the limited commitment to some of the values of conservatism embraced in this new party, despite the name. Some members of the Swedish riksdag abandoned the party even completely when they agreed to join, leaving them independents."

The Trade Union Congresses of Denmark, Sweden and Norway have convened in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. Here they voted to unify all three organisation into an even higher congress known as the Nordic Trade Union Congress. Unsurprisingly, the syndicalist elements followed suit in this, in spite of their alleged opposition to the Nordic project, meaning a unified syndicalist cause now exists on the Nordic level."
