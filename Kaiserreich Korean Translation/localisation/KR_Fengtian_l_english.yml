FNG_CHI_CONQUERED:0 "우리가 중국을 통일함"
FNG_Fortress_Manchuria_i:0 "만주 요새화"
FNG_Fortress_Manchuria_i_desc:0 "The Yan Mountains to the South, the Lesser Khigan Range to the West, and the Bohai Gulf to the East create a natural fortress around the Manchurian plain, leaving the Shanhai Pass as the only easy point of entry. It is easy to fortify the Northeast when nature has already done so much of the work."
FNG_The_National_Reclamation_War:0 "국가 개간 전쟁"
FNG_The_National_Reclamation_War_desc:0 "The time has come to reclaim the South and cast down the regressive Qing. The nation rallies behind its leader in the push toward victory!"
FNG_Backward_Industry:0 "낙후된 산업"
FNG_Backward_Industry_desc:0 "While Fengtian may contain the second largest industrial base in East Asia, its size conceals obsolete machinery, inefficient practices, and severe mismanagement. Only extensive reforms, backed by a great deal of investment, can overcome these challenges."
FNG_Unscrupulous_Governance:0 "부도덕한 통치 방식"
FNG_Unscrupulous_Governance_desc:0 "Despite its claims to the contrary, the Fengtian Government is plagued by endemic corruption, incompetence, and abuse of power. While this is nothing out of the ordinary for China, it impedes the proper functioning of government, and limits support for the regime."
FNG_Investment_Dearth:0 "투자의 부족"
FNG_Investment_Dearth_desc:0 "The economic collapse that followed Fengtian's entry into the Civil Wars severely damaged its fiscal base and financial credibility, leaving the government with few creditors, and private businesses with severely limited options.

FNG_Investment_Dearth_Japanese:0 "제한된 중국 투자"
FNG_Investment_Dearth_Japanese_desc:0 "Thanks to government incentives Japanese investment has grown, but there is still an overall shortage. Local Chinese investment could provide the funds we need."

FNG_Central_Bank_Collapse:0 "중앙 은행 붕괴"
FNG_Central_Bank_Collapse_desc:0 "The Central Bank seems to have misplaced millions of taels worth of silver precisely as Japanese banks called for their loans to be repaid. How could this have happened?"
FNG_Japanese_Military_Mission:0 "일본 군사고문단"
FNG_Japanese_Military_Mission_desc:0 "Japan has had a military presence in Fengtian since at least the early twenties, but the intervention of 1926 saw the dispatch of a permanent military mission, which provides military aid and 'advises' the government. Unfortunately, ignoring this advice can have dire consequences."
FNG_Educational_Vacuum:0 "교육 공백"
FNG_Educational_Vacuum_desc:0 "The sudden absence of Japanese teachers, professors, and scientists has left a troublesome educational vacuum. Foreign and domestic replacements can be found, but at a cost, and not without great inconvenience."

FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_1_desc:0 "Even at its most limited, Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's economy and infrastructure was tight, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is crippled. It will take time to rebuild and reorganise, but if Mantetsu's influence was greater, it could have been far worse."
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_2:0 "독립 이후의 혼란"
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_2_desc:0 "Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's politics, economy, and infrastructure was tight, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is crippled.

FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_3_desc:0 "Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's politics, economy and infrastructure was choking, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is utterly crippled. It will take a very long time to rebuild and reorganise."

FNG_Army_Dominance:0 "군대 지배력"

FNG_Plutocratic_Exploitation:0 "금권 정치 이용"

FNG_informal_empire_5_desc:0 "Japanese expertise and Mantetsu's influence propels Fengtian forward in ways previously thought impossible, but for all intents and purposes most meaningful control has passed from the hands of the Assembly to Japan.

### Focuses ###
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order:0 "Preservation of the Xinhai Order"
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order_desc:0 "Ironically, Fengtian is the sole national government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although its republican commitments are questionable, and Southern reclamation is currently unrealistic, the government has loudly advocated both goals, as they foster domestic legitimacy."
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing:0 "Fuguo Qiangbing"
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing_desc:0 "Translating roughly to 'Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army', this proverb dates back to ancient legalist philosophers, but has been used more recently to inspire reforms in both Guangxu Era China and Meiji Era Japan. Now it is applied again in Fengtian, as the government seeks to modernise and eventually strike South against the resurgent Qing Dynasty, and from there establish control over all China."
#Enrich the Country Branch
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation:0 "Enrich the Country"
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation_desc:0 "Manchuria's strength lies in its bountiful natural resources, characterised by Japanese publications as a 'boundless cornucopia', and its deposits of strategic resources like coal and iron have been designated as of "world-class significance". With a little Japanese help, Fengtian can forge for itself both a prosperous future and a mighty war-machine!"
#Mantetsu Collaboration Section

FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration_desc:0 "Mantetsu, also known as the 'South Manchuria Railway Company', exerts an enormous amount of control over our economy, with numerous subsidiaries ranging from flour mills to hospitals.

FNG_The_Soy_Agricultural_Initiative:0 "The Soy Agricultural Initiative"
FNG_The_Soy_Agricultural_Initiative_desc:0 "Fengtian's significant Korean minority are skilled rice planters, but soybeans have become an extremely desirable cash crop, as they provide not only an excellent source of food, fertiliser, and animal feed, but also soy oil with industrial applications. Mantetsu undertook an effort to educate Koreans in Soy farming, but the response has been mixed. They now want our help to push this through."
FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise:0 "Japanese Electrical Expertise"

FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing_desc:0 "Mantetsu's Research Wing, known as 'Mantetsu Chōsabu', serves as the centrepiece of Japan's colonial program, and pursues a wide variety of scientific goals. Its massive funding and talent pool could be of great use to us in our own efforts."

FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Manchuria's abundant coal deposits make for an excellent power source, but the strong currents of the Yalu and Songhua rivers could provide additional power at minimal expense.

FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods_desc:0 "Japan's quest for crucial oil lead it to Manchuria, but now with disappointing results from prospecting, coal gasification seems the only logical path forward.

FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development_desc:0 "The port city of Yingkou serves as Fengtian's primary gateway to the world, and the second largest port on the Bohai Gulf after Japanese-controlled Dalian.

FNG_Re-Introduce_the_Fengtian_Dollar:0 "Re-introduce the Fengtian Dollar"
FNG_Re-Introduce_the_Fengtian_Dollar_desc:0 "The Fengtian Dollar was one of Wang Yongjiang's later experiments, and served as a currency not backed by silver but still payable in tax, demonstrating the government's faith in its value but requiring no extra silver to print. Following enormous government expenditures during the Civil Wars and subsequent inflation, the currency was discontinued, but its flexibility could be useful today."
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies:0 "Support Sino-Japanese Joint Companies"
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies_desc:0 "A great number of businesses in Fengtian offer shares to both Chinese and Japanese, including the infamous Mantetsu, but relatively few Chinese have the funds to invest and as a result most joint companies are Japanese dominated. Government backing may permit us to provide means and incentives to fellow Chinese and gradually shift this balance."
FNG_Encourage_Chinese_Investment:0 "Encourage Chinese Investment"

FNG_Fill_the_Silver_Reserve:0 "Fill the Silver Reserve"
FNG_Fill_the_Silver_Reserve_desc:0 "The Fengtian Yuan, our principal currency, is backed by silver and in the past has even gained value against the Japanese Yen. This has been met by Japanese insistence that our reserves have never held enough silver to properly back the currency. Regrettably, there may have been some truth to this, and so more silver must be purchased if we are to attract additional investment."
FNG_Encourage_Japanese_Investment:0 "Encourage Japanese Investment"
FNG_Encourage_Japanese_Investment_desc:0 "Unfortunately foreign capital is crucial to our development efforts, and so we must make attempts to attract Japanese alongside Chinese investors.

FNG_Empower_the_Warlords_desc:0 "Until the foundation of the Republic, Zhang Zuolin never possessed complete control over the four provinces. Instead he exercised hegemony over a series of weaker warlords, who were later folded into the new government through a Japanese backed centralisation campaign.

FNG_The_Jilin_Incident:0 "The Jilin Incident"
FNG_The_Jilin_Incident_desc:0 "It has become clear that the divide between the Old and Young Guard factions has only widened as a result of their recent ascent to power.

This warrants investigation, and possibly decisive action."

FNG_Entrust_the_Assembly_desc:0 "Since the Xinhai Revolution nearly two decades ago, no democratic government in China has successfully drafted and adopted a constitution, and in order to gain the full support of the people in our efforts to retake the South we must entrust the Assembly with this important task."
FNG_The_Autumn_Program:0 "The Autumn Program"
FNG_The_Autumn_Program_desc:0 "On the heels of negotiations last Autumn, influential members of the Recovery League, Communications Clique, and Zhang Clique have set out a program outlining their intent to draft a Constitution. A key point of cooperation is a shared understanding that, without such measures, the government risks losing its way and will never hold the true support of the Chinese people."
FNG_The_Harbin_Convention:0 "The Harbin Convention"
FNG_The_Harbin_Convention_desc:0 "An effective constitution will only come as a product of a convention bringing together all of the major parties, and it goes without saying that some may attempt to disrupt the proceedings.

FNG_Found_the_Shenyang_National_Academy_desc:0 "The increase in Japanese influence in the Northeast after the Civil Wars lead to the shutdown of the old Military Academy of the Three Eastern Provinces, with recruits now sent to Japan for an education at a nearly prohibitive cost.

FNG_Modernized_Curriculum_desc:0 "The modern Japanese curriculum, designed to counter Russian aggression on the plains of Manchuria, emphasises morale factors and tenacity of the will, stressing training designed to develop the ability to recognise opportunities for decisive attack; enveloping open enemy flanks, encircling formations, and thus destroying numerically and technologically superior forces."

FNG_Ties_of_Loyalty:0 "Ties of Loyalty"
FNG_Ties_of_Loyalty_desc:0 "The Army's leadership structure is virtually feudal, and most of our generals and troops owe their personal loyalty to the Grand Marshal, instead of any abstract concept of state.

It is not recommended that you play any faction in China outside the Northeast (Fengtian), and if you choose to do so you proceed 'at your own risk'. We apologise for the mess, and order should be restored once the China Rework is finally complete."
fengtian.new.0.a:0 "이해했다"
fengtian.new.1.t:0 "Huanghanhui Crackdown"
fengtian.new.1.d:0 "The Huanghanhui, or Imperial Han Society, has been found to be using bribes and threats of violence to coerce low-level members of the Assembly. Unfortunately this information has gone public, even as the Assemblymen in question have been removed from office, and local police pursue additional suspects.\n\nShortly after information regarding this incident was presented to Japanese authorities, Kempeitai agents were observed entering an enclosed compound outside Shenyang, and reports indicate gunfire was exchanged. Over a dozen bodies were removed from the premises, and it would be unwise to pursue this matter any further."
fengtian.new.1.a:0 "문제군"
fengtian.new.2.t:0 "Communications Clique Leads Railroad Strikes"
fengtian.new.2.d:0 "The Communications Clique, with its widespread influence in Chinese-owned Manchurian railroads like the CER, has resorted to encouraging union activity and strikes to compensate for its recent losses of influence in government. The Clique will likely only go so far, for risk of creating something it cannot control, but their methods have already been fairly successful in demonstrating their political and economic clout."

#Land Reform Events
fengtian.new.3.t:0 "Land Disputes in Heilongjiang"
fengtian.new.3.d:0 "As a product of various socio-economic changes, such as the steady shift of seasonal workers from the agricultural north to industrial jobs in Fengtian Province, land disputes have begun to flare up at an alarming rate. Normally these matters would be handled by the local Xiangshen, landlords, retired officials, clan elders, and scholars who 'represent' peasants in meetings with county officials. On this occasion, however, a large collection of peasants have bypassed local authorities and are attempting to petition the government directly. Normally such a petition, unworthy of the central government's attention, would be brushed aside, but unfortunately the situation has attracted the attention of the Asahi Shimbun, a leftist Japanese newspaper. \n\nThe local Xiangshen, believing this matter to be solely within their jurisdiction, request that they be allowed to settle the matter themselves, refuting accusations of favouritism and corruption by the peasants. On the one hand, throughout all of Chinese history the Central Government has never truly been able to exert influence over the Xiangshen, but on the other the peasants grow increasingly desperate, and the entire region is watching."
fengtian.new.3.a:0 "Support the Xiangshen"
fengtian.new.3.b:0 "Support Local Land Reform"
fengtian.new.4.t:0 "Clamour for Further Land Reform"
fengtian.new.4.d:0 "Despite the government's efforts to resolve the land disputes in the north, the matter has again arisen, the farmers likely emboldened by their predecessors and the publicity they received. The situation is fairly similar, as the Xiangshen once again assert their authority, and the peasants demand increased control over their land and what happens on it. \n\nThis petition, however, has double the signatures, and with the results of the last case fresh in their minds, other farmers begin to grumble."
fengtian.new.4.a:0 "Support the Xiangshen"
fengtian.new.4.b:0 "Support Local Land Reform"
fengtian.new.5.t:0 "Land Reform Reaches the Assembly"
fengtian.new.5.d:0 "It is unusual for members of the Recovery League to stray far from their usual statements about southern reclamation, or from the scripts prepared for them by deep-pocketed 'friends', but some more liberal minded members of the Assembly have received a landslide of peasant petitions regarding land reform, and have decided to champion their cause. They argue that if our republican government aims to truly embody the values of the Xinhai Revolution and to differentiate itself from the archaic Qing, it must satisfy the needs of the common people, and strip away the sort of feudalism that the Xiangshen represent. \n\nThis group of vocal politicians remains a minority amid an otherwise indifferent Assembly, and advisers warn that the Xiangshen as a whole are not to be trifled with, but this decision ultimately lies in the Marshal's hands."
fengtian.new.5.a:0 "Support the Xiangshen"
fengtian.new.5.b:0 "Support widespread land reform"
#Land Reform Event Conclusions
fengtian.new.6.t:0 "Peasant Unrest Quelled"
fengtian.new.6.d:0 "Given a taste of land reform, but denied its full flavor, unsatisfied peasants rose up in several northern villages, only to be put down by local garrisons. To add to the sad and embarrassing situation, the commander of a nearby Japanese brigade patrolling the Russian border decided to intervene, adding the impression that foreign influence was behind the crackdown, and that the central government is incapable of keeping order without outside assistance. \n\nThis situation might have been handled better."
fengtian.new.6.a:0 "Damnable peasants!"
fengtian.new.7.t:0 "Widespread Peasant Unrest Quelled"
fengtian.new.7.d:0 "Given a taste of land reform, but denied its full flavor, unsatisfied peasants rose up across the north, overwhelming local garrisons and posing a threat to to the regional command at Qihihar. Fortunately the lightly armed farmers were poorly organised, lacking any kind of leadership structure, and so upon the full deployment of the regional general's forces, the attackers were dispersed and many slaughtered. \n\nUnfortunately, however, the loose discipline of the troops turned mere securing of towns into a looting frenzy, which was soon joined by nearby Japanese troops who apparently felt themselves 'under threat'. Our soldiers have been disciplined, but the damage has been done, and it is difficult to understate the current ill-will held toward the central government. The Xiangshen, smugly assured of their correctness all along, are happy to wait before re-asserting their authority to let the pain and embarrassment fully sink in."
fengtian.new.7.a:0 "What a disaster!"
fengtian.new.8.t:0 "Land Reform Underway"
fengtian.new.8.d:0 "For better or worse, land reform is now underway at both the local and national levels, with officials superseding the local Xiangshen to assert the central government's sovereignty for the first time in hundreds of years. However, while they have used that time to thoroughly game the machine of local administration, they were also its designers and engineers, forcing officials to proverbially re-invent the wheel. While many are satisfied, the economy is certain to suffer considerably, and it is unclear just how far the reforms will be able to go."
fengtian.new.8.a:0 "This is the price of progress"
#The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling
fengtian.new.9.t:0 "만철 학교교육의 향방"
fengtian.new.9.d:0 "Mantetsu has long maintained a series of privately run schools originally intended for the sons and daughters of employees, as well as Japanese immigrants, which pride themselves on providing an education comparable to or even exceeding those available in the Home Islands. At the Japanese government's behest, these schools were more recently opened to the paying public, clearly as part of an attempt to spread Japanese culture and norms. However, the schools are crucial to education, not only because many children of Fengtian's wealthy are enrolled, but also because they provide their services at no government cost. \n\nAny attempt to close the Mantetsu schools to the public will be met not only with Japanese outrage, but a state of educational chaos as we try to pick up the slack. While the civil service has undergone reforms, it remains questionable as to whether our economy and domestic educational staff will be up to the challenge."
fengtian.new.9.a:0 "학교를 폐쇄한다."
fengtian.new.9.b:0 "There is no choice"
fengtian.new.10.t:0 "The Kimono Scandal"
fengtian.new.10.d:0 "Scandal! In a most unfortunate turn of events, the Grand Marshal's youngest daughter has been photographed wearing a Japanese Kimono during a photo-session at the Mantetsu-run 'Hokutou Kunitachidaigaku' or 'Northeast National Academy'. Despite risk of arrest, word of the photo has already spread widely, along with a few copies of the image itself, though local and national news agencies know better than to print this defamation. Some agents in the military's intelligence branch speculate that the image was intentionally taken and spread by the Japanese as a means of punishing the government for recent actions, but no supporting evidence has emerged. \n\nThere is little question, however, that the Qing will use this opportunity to spread their nefarious propaganda."
fengtian.new.10.a:0 "What an embarrassment!"
fengtian.new.10.b:0 "Close the Mantetsu schools!"
fengtian.new.11.t:0 "Students Join the Youth League"
fengtian.new.11.d:0 "In an embarrassing and deeply damaging incident, a band of Chinese school children from Changchun recently announced their intention to join the Fengtian Youth League, which actively promotes Japanese interests in our country. Obviously their young minds are easily impressionable, but their parade through the streets of their home city, waving Japanese flags, has disgusted many, and invited outright enmity toward themselves and the government. Parents weep, asking how their children could become so warped, and demand an alternative to these dangerous Japanese-run schools."
fengtian.new.11.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
fengtian.new.11.b:0 "힉교를 폐쇄한다."
fengtian.new.12.t:0 "Chinese Uniforms for Chinese Students"
fengtian.new.12.d:0 "After some time and effort, as well as considerable expense, several new Chinese-run schools have pooled their resources to produce a new standard uniform for our students. While this may seem like a small change, the uniforms are a symbol of Chinese independence, as well as a disciplined and modern society. Surely a bright new future awaits!"
fengtian.new.12.a:0 "A point of pride!"
#NTC Railway Construction

fengtian.new.13.d:0 "With the reorganisation of the Northeast Transportation Committee complete, several new railways have been proposed for construction and, in some cases, completion. The first major project is the Jilin-Hailong Railway, originally planned in 1927, which met serious delays in construction due to the eruption of war in the south, and concerted Japanese attempts to stall it. The line has been operating in limited capacity since 1931, but remains incomplete, with a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building.\n\nThese companies, in the abscence of Mantetsu and Japanese engineers, will do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."

fengtian.new.15.d:0 "The NTC's next major project, originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities, the Changchun-Dalai line should serve to ease the movement of men and materials from North to South significantly."
fengtian.new.15.d_jap:0 "The NTC's next major project, originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities, the Changchun-Dalai line should serve to ease the movement of men and materials from North to South significantly. While the line does have Japanese origins and would serve to extend Mantetsu's reach, NTC planners nonetheless note its practical value. As before, Mantetsu offers to carry out the construction process themselves, but Chinese companies stand ready to perform the same task."

fengtian.new.17.d:0 "The final of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line, which like other recent constructions, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway."
fengtian.new.17.d_jap:0 "The final of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line, which like other recent works, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas.

Apparently, following the Drought of 1939, Mantetsu brought together farming experts, senior officials from agricultural organisations, and academic scholars with relevant expertise in order to lead an initiative with the aim of improving agricultural efficiency and production in Fengtian. After months of testing, one of several research teams created a solution based upon farming methods used in Hokkaido, which might allow the average Chinese family to farm ten entire hectares of land without needing to hire seasonal workers, thus improving production and freeing up labour for factories in Anshan, Fushun, and Shenyang. The Mantetsu official indicates that these methods should be spread through the dissemination of informational leaflets and Chinese instructors, themselves trained by Japanese experts, and he seemed to stress the idea that this project should be disassociated in every possible way from the South Manchurian Railway. \n\nAfter some investigation, the Army's intelligence section has determined that the Kwantung Army refused to support Mantetsu's efforts for unclear reasons, suggesting that the two factions may be competing, or that this is simply a part of some elaborate Japanese ruse. The relatively liberal officials in Mantetsu's research wing and other bureaucratic roles have been known to clash with the conservative Kwantung Army."

The Kwantung Army's ability to punish Mantetsu is ultimately limited, as the powerful company is practically autonomous, but there's little doubt that the Army will go out of its way to make things difficult for everyone involved.

Fengtian's biggest investor is the state itself, feeding tax revenues back into key sectors such as steel, coal, and soybean production. Yet, the Japanese and Mantetsu trail the government only marginally in this regard, and invest far more widely, giving them an unquestioned grip upon both Fengtian's economy and society. \n\nWhile the extent of this grip grows by the day, reform could serve to increase the government's revenues through the suppression of otherwise endemic corruption, the creation of a healthier environment for private investment, and the unfortunate but necessary cooperation with Mantetsu in key areas like infrastructure and technology. So long as the government can maintain political autonomy, and at least a majority of control over the economy, it can pursue initiatives to contest Japanese influence, retain legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people, and eventually achieve its core goals. \n\nIt should be noted that while Japan has a vested interest in seeing us succeed relative to the Qing, they will only provide assistance with specific efforts aiming to move past our backward industry, even as they attempt to widen their already worrying influence over our economy."

The majority of Fengtian's weapons and vehicles are outdated, even including its standard issue rifle provided by the Japanese, and organisation below the division level is a patchy affair due to limited communications equipment. The Army's greatest deficiency is in morale, partially as a consequence of foreign-trained and even outright Japanese officers widespread throughout the ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fengtian Flying Corps, officially The China Flying Corps, is the pride and joy of the Grand Marshal's oldest son, Zhang Xueliang, who used his passion for aviation to train its first pilots. The Flying Corps performed well during the Civil Wars, and lost air superiority over the Zhili only upon the arrival of modern German-piloted planes. Since then, the Corps has grown slightly, though its planes remain over a decade behind the European standard. \n\nOverall, Fengtian's forces lag behind those of the Qing, and remain heavily dependent upon Japanese equipment and aid. This aid, and whatever Fengtian can do to become self-sufficient, will be crucial to narrowing that gap and eventually reclaiming the south."

Jehol, to the Southwest of Fengtian Province, remained untouched by the reorganisation, but has suffered thanks to the end of rail traffic through the Liaoxi Corridor, which connected land transportation between Beijing and the Northeast.

Extensive tax reform solved outstanding debts, and by the early 1920s the economy was bolstered by immigrants fleeing instability throughout the rest of China.\n\nOf course, this could not last, and Minister Wang died in 1929. With Fengtian's economy only beginning to recover from eight years of post-war decline, the time has come to implement new reforms, inspired by those of the old, and return the Northeast to its rightful place as one of China's most prosperous regions.\n\nA minister must be chosen to draw up the necessary plans, and determine priorities for government efforts."

All the same, while treaty rights permit Japanese to reside and engage in business and manufacture of any kind, construction still theoretically requires approval from the local governor and, if necessary, the Grand Marshal himself.\n\nMantetsu aims to build a series of new hotels, all of which will inevitably become hubs for further Japanese activity, and while construction could never be stopped without angering the Japanese government, limits might be imposed to forestall Japanese influence in certain areas. Unfortunately, as much as they may stand as physical edifices of Japan's strength, the hotels are frequented by the Japanese elite and many Mantetsu employees, making them crucial for the rapid development we desire."

The Communications Clique recommends their own presence, and advocate a mixed developmental approach, referencing their long experience with business dealings across China, as well as more recently here in the Northeast. \n\nUnfortunately, a compromise involving all three parties is practically impossible, as a clear vision is necessary for the task, and intra-commission bickering would almost certainly render it functionally impotent. Additionally, although the commission's nature as an appointed body permits the presence of Japanese in its makeup, the public and much of the Assembly will likely react negatively to their presence.

Japanese officers in particular are known to prize any station in Fengtian, the devalued currency allowing them to live lives of relative luxury, and hire servants for most menial tasks, earning them the enmity of not only their fellows but also the local population. \n\nNow, with the founding of the Shenyang National Academy, these officers have taken the opportunity to mock the academy's current accommodations, specifically a former fabric factory near central Shenyang.

This has had a negative effect upon the morale of our men, making Japan's influence all too obvious, even as the Military Mission attempts, and often succeeds, in influencing our affairs of government.

The conversation, in which the Grand Marshal described "enemies to the North, South, East, and West", puts Fengtian's relations with Japan in unconventionally blunt terms damaging to our propaganda and Japan's interests. \n\nThe broadcast was doubly damaging thanks to its capture of Zhang discussing the realities of Qing's relative industrial and military strength, and the degree to which we must rely on the Japanese for crucial technology, something which we have been careful to conceal from the public."

fengtian.new.151.d:0 "As the year 1936 dawns, Fengtian stands in the Northeast as the final bastion of China's Republican dream. As with many things in China however, the abstractions of this dream hide complex and often inconvenient truths. The Fengtian Government of the Republic of China, contesting Qing's claims to legitimacy, maintains democracy only as a thin veneer, covering what has always been, and perhaps always will be, an authoritarian state.\n\nThe Assembly in Shenyang is widely regarded to be corrupt, power divided between autocratic generals, unscrupulous railway barons, and Pan-Asianist ideologues with questionable motivations. Amid it all stands Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, his ambitions great, but limited by the stark realities of Qing strength and Japanese power; for now forced to walk a political tightrope between the two, and above the machinations of his own divided government. The status quo cannot last forever, and if the right moment to strike south is not chosen soon, it may never come at all.\n\nThe staggering cost of the wars with the south and the severance of economic ties left Fengtian reeling, and while past years have been spent rebuilding, there is much left to do. Likewise the army has suffered from neglect, and must be reorganized. The Japanese, their influence growing by the day, present both a dire threat and an opportunity. The waters ahead are treacherous, and it will take a truly great helmsman to steer the ship of state not only to survival, but also toward the reclamation of all China.\n\nBriefings are available on Fengtian's special mechanics, its relationship with the Japanese, and internal politics."

The parties, more accurately termed factions, exercise their grip through dominance of the country's institutions instead of mass appeal. As such, the 'popularity' of parties should be taken to represent their degree of control over the country's government and other structures of power, control being determined not by the popular policies of ministers, but by choices, focuses, and events that increase or diminish their power.\n\nConsequently, your aim should be to balance the various factions, each of which has the potential to abuse their power if given too much of it, though each will do so differently. As they grow in strength, the factions will nominate ministers, each of whom will pursue his own agenda, potentially in line with his faction, or his country, but which could also have negative consequences in the short or long term.\n\nAnother crucial point is the role of the Concordia Association, also explained in the politics briefing, the strength of which can be taken as a loose indicator of Japanese influence over the country. As their influence grows, it will lead to increasing bonuses to production, but at the cost of political power and autonomy. The rise of this influence is inevitable over time, and should be viewed with caution."

While the Grand Marshal and others utilise a wide variety of means to slow and inconvenience the Japanese, their presence is necessary and the growth of their influence inevitable. The primary institution responsible for this growth is the South Manchuria Railway Company, more commonly termed 'Mantetsu', the profits from which in recent years have accounted for nearly a quarter of Japan's entire national budget.\n\nAt the same time, the Japanese need Fengtian and what it represents. Its cooperation and the prospect of a victory in the South offer to save Japan a great deal of time and money. The result is a tenuous balance, the Japanese ever looking for more profit and power, but well aware that pushing too hard will place Zhang Zuolin in a politically untenable position, and thus bring their careful efforts to naught.\n\nSo far Zhang has pursued a patchwork policy; promotion of Pan-Asian brotherhood with Japan, only to intermittently replace this with repudiations of Japanese initiatives that push too far, and consistent private efforts to lessen Japanese influence. How to proceed will be your choice, but caution is advised."

The Zhang Clique\n\nA collection of loyalists and generals, the Zhang Clique holds no specific ideology beyond promoting the furtherance of the Grand Marshal's political powers. While making pretenses to democracy, Zhang's supporters are not committed to republican ideals, and promote them only for their utility.\n\n3. The Communications Clique\n\nThe sole politically coherent faction to emerge from the former Beiyang Government, the Communications Clique are a collection of railroad and telegraph barons, primarily self-interested, but locked in confrontation with Mantetsu and the Concordia Association over the country's infrastructure.\n\n4. The Concordia Association\n\nA grouping of politicians and lobbyists with all the trappings of a party, the Concordia Association represents the interests of Mantetsu, and sometimes other Japanese Zaibatsu, in the Assembly.

This time Interior Minister Yuan is pressuring the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway and Economic Minister, Li Shaogeng, to levy additional taxes on the railway for the purposes of further strengthening the army; threatening an investigation of Communications Clique assets, as well as various fees the Board already charges its customers, the revenue from which almost certainly sticks to a number of fingers.\n\nThere is every likelyhood that, as Yuan is a member of the CER board himself, this is a power-play on his part to weaken his rivals, but such a tax would undoubtedly help fill the national treasury, if at the cost of undercutting competition to Mantetsu.

Wu has served in the position before, and is known for his fierce opposition to the regressive Qing monarchy, though he has also been an outspoken critic of Japanese involvement in China. As a result, he could be a vital asset in the propaganda war against Qing, or a substantial inconvenience in our complicated relationship with Japan. \n\nWu's extant ties to the Foreign Ministry and its importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision rests with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.1.d_Chang:0 "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Chang Chun, a prominent politician with close ties to Huang Fu and the late Dr Sun Yat-sen, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. Having studied at the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko before the Revolution, Chang can be said to have a working understanding with the Japanese while still remaining distant from the Concordia Society, making him especially well suited to manage the complicated relationship between our two governments. \n\nThe Recovery League's ties to the Foreign Ministry means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the Grand Marshal can veto the decision at any time."

Pan is known to be an experienced in the role, having served both under the Beiyang Government and our own, but during that time he built up an unfortunate reputation for shady dealings and corruption. He has yet to be convicted of any crime, and it's even possible that these widely held suspicions are unfounded, but his past seems likely to haunt him if he reoccupies his old post. \n\nDespite the risk, the Recovery League's advantage in government means that only the Grand Marshal can prevent his appointment."
fngpolitic.2.d_Chang:0 "With the Foreign Ministry firmly under their control, the Recovery League has set its sights on the office of the Economic Minister, proposing Chang Chun as a replacement for its current occupant.

fngpolitic.11.d_Sun:0 "The Foreign Ministry is usually regarded as a Recovery League stronghold, but with most cabinet positions under their control, the Zhang Clique has proposed that Sun Qichang become Foreign Minister. Of all the possible candidates from his faction, Sun is perhaps the most qualified, with service to the Beiyang Government as a diplomat in Jilin Province, and as a consultant for the Foreign Ministry in matters concerning Russia. \n\nIf the Grand Marshal decides to go forward with the appointment, the Recovery League will likely be deeply displeased by their loss of control over their prised position."
fngpolitic.11.d_Wang:0 "The Foreign Ministry is usually regarded as a Recovery League stronghold, but with most cabinet positions under their control, the Zhang Clique has proposed that Wang Yintai become Foreign Minister. Of all the possible candidates from his faction, Wang is perhaps one of the most qualified, with a degree in law, years as Zhang Zuolin's legal adviser, and a brief stint as the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Beiyang Government. \n\nHowever, Wang is weakened by his status as something of an outsider, lacking comradery with many of the officers in his own faction, his position within which he holds almost exclusively thanks to the Grand Marshal's personal patronage."

fngpolitic.12.d_Ruan:0 "Thanks to their growing influence in government, the Concordia Association has nominated Ruan Zhenduo for the position of Economic Minister. Though trained as a doctor and not an economist, Ruan's extensive ties to the Japanese in the medical field lead to his meteoric rise in politics, and he now acts as the primary go-between for the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Concordia Association. While his lack of experience in economics may be a concern, Ruan is known to be diligent, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry's handling of events in Fengtian is notably more cautious than that of Mantetsu or the Kwantung Army. \n\nThe final decision ultimately rests with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.12.d_Yu:0 "Thanks to their growing influence in government, the Concordia Association has nominated Yu Zhishan for the position of Economic Minister. An Army officer through-and-through, Yu takes a pragmatic approach to Fengtian's position visa-vis Japan, seeing it as the only way for Fengtian to defeat the South, and for China as a whole to retain its identity in the face of Western domination. With a great deal of experience managing supply lines and weapons production during the War, Yu is likely to pursue a policy emphasising military industrialisation, closely aligning his position with the interests of the Kwantung Army. \n\nThe final decision ultimately rests with the Grand Marshal."

fngpolitic.13.d:0 "With the position of Economic Minister in their grasp, the Concorida Association has pushed to nominate Ruan Zhenduo for the position of Foreign Minister. While he isn't a diplomat by training, Ruan has been a favourite of the Japanese Foreign Office for some time, and has a wide range of contacts there. Though their influence is rarely welcome, it is nonetheless preferable to Mantetsu and the Kwangtung's Army's more aggressive approaches to foreign affairs. Ruan's assumption of the office will undoubtedly also solidify his control over the direction of the Association.\n\nThe choice of whether to accept the nomination naturally rests with the Grand Marshal."

fngpolitic.14.d_Yang:0 "Now with two key cabinet positions within their control, the Concordia Association has nominated Yang Yuting for the position of Interior Minister. Having served as a governor, there is every reason to believe that Yang will make a competent minister, though his experience as a general suggests he is likely to pursue a policy emphasising the military and extensive security measures, a move likely to earn the approval of the Kwantung Army.\n\nThough the placement of an alleged Japanese sympathiser at the head of Fengtian's security apparatus may make some nervous, the ultimate decision lies with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.14.d_Ding:0 "Now with two key cabinet positions within their control, the Concordia Association has nominated Ding Jianxiu for the position of Interior Minister. Highly educated in Japan and a teacher by trade, Ding could be considered one of the most pro-Japanese of the Concordia Association's members, believing strongly in the prospects of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Though the Interior Minister is the functional head of the Fengtian's security apparatus, the less-used functions of the role also permit a great deal of control over government services and funds in general.\n\nAs a result, some worry that Ding could further empower Japan's economic and cultural initatives across the country, though he is known to staunchly oppose the Kwantung Army's military orientated agenda.\n\nThe decision ultimately lies with the Grand Marshal."

With military training, years served in the field, and a long stint as the Police Commissioner for the Chinese Eastern Railway Special District, Bao is as qualified as anyone for the position. However, unsurprisingly, questions arise over whether someone with close ties to the Japanese should be given a position of such authority.\n\nThe Grand Marshal can always refuse to appoint him."
fngpolitic.15.d_Ding:0 "Having consolidated a great deal of influence, the Concordia Association has nominated Ding Jianxiu to serve as Head of Intelligence. Ding's experience in the field is limited to his former positions teaching at Military and Police Academies in Shenyang, but even then he taught law as opposed to having any hands-on experience with policing or intelligence. While he may be unsuited for the role in some respects, Ding's knowledge of the law could make him useful for circumventing it, though of course his political associations leave his loyalties questionable.\n\nAs usual, the Grand Marshal may, or may not, accept the nomination."

fengtian.informalempire.2.d:0 "Fengtian is the sole standing government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although some say that our republican commitments are questionable, and full scale war against the restored Qing is currently unrealistic, the government loudly advocates both goals, as they foster legitimacy in the eyes of all Chinese."
